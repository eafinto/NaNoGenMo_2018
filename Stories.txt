Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,’ thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?’

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!’ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT- POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE’, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.

`Well!’ thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!’ (Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! `I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?’ she said aloud. `I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think–‘ (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `–yes, that’s about the right distance–but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?’ (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)

Presently she began again. `I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think–‘ (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) `–but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?’ (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke–fancy CURTSEYING as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.’

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. `Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!’ (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?’ And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?’ and sometimes, `Do bats eat cats?’ for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?’ when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!’ She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if my head would go through,’ thought poor Alice, `it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.’ For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which certainly was not here before,’ said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME’ beautifully printed on it in large letters.

It was all very well to say `Drink me,’ but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I’ll look first,’ she said, `and see whether it’s marked “poison” or not’; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked `poison,’ it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.

However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,’ so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

`What a curious feeling!’ said Alice; `I must be shutting up like a telescope.’

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going though the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; `for it might end, you know,’ said Alice to herself, `in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?’ And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.

After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found he had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.

`Come, there’s no use in crying like that!’ said Alice to herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!’ She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. `But it’s no use now,’ thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!’

Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words `EAT ME’ were beautifully marked in currants. `Well, I’ll eat it,’ said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!’

She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which way? Which way?’, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.

So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

 Once upon a time, there was a pretty young girl named Cinderella. She lived with her widowed father. He loved her very much, but thought she needed a mother. So he married a woman with two daughters named Anastasia and Drizella. Not long after that, he died. 
    Cinderella's stepmother, Lady Tremaine, spent most of the family fortune. She forced Cinderella to become a servant and live in a cold, dark attic. Day in and day out, Cinderella did all of the household chores - from feeding the chickens to polishing the chandeliers. She waited on her stepsisters and stepmother hand and foot. Yet nothing she did ever pleased them. 
    No matter how mean her stepmother and stepsisters were, Cinderella was always cheerful. She made friends with the mice and birds and even sewed little outfits for them. Two of Cinderella's best friends were mice named Jaq and Gus. 
    One day, a messenger delivered an invitation to a royal ball. It was to be held that night at the palace. All the unmarried maidens in the kingdom were invited - the King wanted to find a wife for his son. 
    "Why, that means I can go, too!" Cinderella cried. Her stepsisters just laughed at her. They thought it was funny that a servant would think she could go to the ball.
    "Well, why not?" asked Cinderella. "It says, 'By royal command, every eligible maiden is to attend.'"
    Her stepmother looked at the invitation. "Well, I see no reason why you can't go," she said, "if you get all your work done and if you can find something suitable to wear." 
    Cinderella was delighted. She ran upstairs at once. 
    In her attic room, Cinderella opened her trunk and found a pink gown that had belonged to her mother. It was a little old-fashioned, but she knew she could make it into a beautiful dress.
    All of a sudden, Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters called for her. The gown would have to wait. 
    Lady Tremaine gave her stepdaughter a long list of chores to make certain that she wouldn't be able to go to the ball. Even if Cinderella finished, she wouldn't have time to fix the dress.
    That evening, as Anastasia, Drizella, and Lady Tremaine were just about to leave for the ball, Cinderella went upstairs to her room. She had just finished her chores. Cinderella walked over to the window and looked out sadly at the palace in the distance. 
    But when she turned around, a surprise was waiting for her. The birds and mice had fixed her mother's old dress using ribbons and beads that Anastasia and Drizella had thrown away. 
    Cinderella was overjoyed. She thanked her friends and ran downstairs. When her stepsisters saw the gown and how beautiful Cinderella looked in it, they were furious. 
    "That's my sash!" Anastasia yelled as she ripped Cinderella's skirt. 
    "They're my beads!" Drizella cried as she pulled them from her stepsiter's neck. 
    Cinderella's dress was in tatters. Knowing she couldn't go to the ball, she ran into the garden in tears.
    Cinderella was sobbing on a garden bench when a kindly woman appeared. She comforted Cinderella and explained that she was her fairy godmother. 
    Then she waved her wand and said "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo." Suddenly four mice were transformed into four white horses, and a big, round pumpkin became a glittering coach. 
    The Fairy Godmother waved her hand again and turned Cinderella's torn dress into a beautiful blue gown. Now she could go to the ball!
    "Why, it's like a dream...a wonderful dream come true!" Cinderella exclaimed. 
    "You must understand, my dear," the Fairy Godmother said, "on the stroke of twelve, the spell will be broken. And everything will be as it was before." 
    And with that, the coach whisked Cinderella to the palace. 
    At the ball, the Prince met a lot of lovely maidens, but he didn't seem terribly interested in any of them. The King wondered if his son would meet anyone he wanted to marry. 
    Then Cinderella walked in. The Prince was enchanted by her beauty. He walked over to her, and they began to waltz. It was as if Cinderella was the only maiden in the room. The two danced all night. They even waltzed out to the moonlit balcony. Cinderella felt as if she were dreaming. I must be in love, she thought. 
    As the other guests watched the happy couple dance, they wondered who this beautiful young girl could be. No one had ever seen her before, but it was obvious she had stolen the Prince's heart.
    As the clock struck midnight, Cinderella remembered what the Fairy Godmother had said. She quickly ran from the palace before the spell was broken. She was in such a hurry that one of her glass slippers came off as she rushed down the steps. The Prince ran after her, but it was too late. Cinderella was gone, and he hadn't even asked her name. 
    And Cinderella didn't know that the handsome man she had been dancing with was actually the Prince!
    The next day, Cinderella was busy doing her chores when she overheard Lady Tremaine talking to her daughters. It seemed the Grand Duke had been looking all night for the girl who had lost her slipper at the ball. The Prince was madly in love with her.
    "The Prince!" Cinderella exclaimed. She dropped the tray she was carrying. The man she'd been dancing with all night was the Prince? And he was madly in love with her? Could it be true? 
    "Not even the Prince knows who that girl is," Lady Tremaine said. "The glass slipper is their only clue. The Duke has been ordered to try it on every girl in the kingdom. And if no one can be found whom the slipper fits, then by the King's command, that girl shall be the Prince's bride." 
    Cinderella was in shock. "His bride!" she whispered. 
    Her stepsisters began to fight over who would marry the prince. 
    Cinderella started toward her room. She wanted to be wearing something prettier than work clothes when the Grand Duke arrived with the glass slipper. She walked down the hall, happier than she had ever been. Remembering her magical evening, she began to sing and waltz. 
    Lady Tremaine's eyes narrowed. She realized that Cinderella was the mysterious girl from the ball. She followed Cinderella upstairs and locked her in her attic room. She wanted one of her daughters to marry the Prince, not her stepdaughter!
    When the Grand Duke arrived, Anastasia and Drizella both tried on the glass slipper, but their feet were much too big. 
    The Grand Duke was just about to leave when Cinderella rushed down the stairs. "Wait!" she called. 
    Gus and Jaq had stolen the key to Cinderella's room from her stepmother's pocket and freed their friend just in time. 
    Lady Tremaine was furious. She tripped the footman, and the glass slipper fell to the floor and shattered into many pieces.
    Luckily, Cinderella had the matching slipper. She reached into her apron pocket and pulled it out. The slipper was a perfect fit! 
    The Grand Duke took Cinderella to the castle, where she married the Prince. 
    And they lived happily ever after.
   
   If you want to find Cherry-Tree Lane all you have to do is ask the Policeman at the cross-roads. He will push his helmet slightly to one side, scratch his head thoughtfully, and then he will point his huge white-gloved finger and say: "First to your right, second to your left, sharp right again, and you're there. Good-morning." 
    And sure enough, if you follow his directions exactly, you will be there - right in the middle of Cherry-Tree Lane, where the houses run down one side and the Park runs down the other and the cherry-trees go dancing right down the middle. 
    If you are looking for Number Seventeen - and it is more than likely that you will be, for this book is all about that particular house - you will very soon find it. To begin with, it is the smallest house in the Lane. And besides that, it is the only one that is rather dilapidated and needs a coat of paint. But Mr. Banks, who owns it, said to Mrs. Banks that she could have either a nice, clean, comfortable house or four children. But not both, for he couldn't afford it.
    And after Mrs. Banks had given the matter some consideration she came to the conclusion that she would rather have Jane, who was the eldest, and Michael, who came next, and John and Barbara, who were Twins and came last of all. So it was settled, and that was how the Banks family came to live at Number Seventeen, with Mrs. Brill to cook for them, and Ellen to lay the tables, and Robertson Ay to cut the lawn and clean the knives and polish the shoes and, as Mr. Banks always said "to waste his time and my money."
    And, of course, besides these there was Katie Nanna, who doesn't really deserve to come into the book at all because, at the time I am speaking of, she had just left Number Seventeen.
    "Without by your leave or a word of warning. And what am I to do?" said Mrs. Banks.
    "Advertise, my dear," said Mr. Banks, putting on his shoes. "And I wish Robertson Ay would go without a word of warning, for he has again polished one boot and left the other untouched. I shall look very lopsided."
    "That," said Mrs. Banks, "is not of the least importance. You haven't told me what I'm to do about Katie Nanna." 
    "I don't see how you can do anything about her since she has disappeared," replied Mr. Banks, "But if it were me - I mean I - well, I should get somebody to put in the Morning Paper the news that Jane and Michael and John and Barbara Banks (to say nothing of their Mother) require the best possible Nannie at the lowest possible wage and at once. Then I should wait and watch for the Nannies to queue up outside the front gate, and I should get very cross with them for holding up the traffic and making it necessary for me to give the policeman a shilling for putting him to so much trouble. Now I must be off. Whew, it's as cold as the North Pole. Which way is the wind blowing?"
    And as he said that, Mr. Banks popped his head out of the window and looked down the Lane to Admiral Boom's house at the corner. This was the grandest house in the Lane, and the Lane was very proud of it because it was built exactly like a ship. There was a flagstaff in the garden, and on the roof was a gilt weathercock shaped like a telescope. 
    "Ha!" said Mrs. Banks, drawing in his head very quickly. "Admiral's telescope says East Wind. I thought as much. There is frost in my bones. I shall wear two overcoats." And he kissed his wife absentmindedly on one side of her nose and waved to the children and went away to the City. 
    Now, the City was a place where Mr. Banks went every day - except Sundays, of course, and Bank Holidays - and while he was there he sat on a large chair in front of a large desk and made money. All day long he worked, cutting out pennies and shillings and half-crowns and threepenny-bits. And he brought them home with him in his little black bag. Sometimes he would give some to Jane and Michael for their money-boxes, and when he couldn't spare any he would say, "The Bank is broken," and they would know he hadn't made much money that day. 
    Well, Mr. Banks went off with his black bag, and Mrs. Banks went into the drawing-room and sat there all day long writing letters to the papers and begging them to send some Nannies to her at once as she was waiting; and upstairs in the Nursery, Jane and Michael watched at the window and wondered who would come. They were glad Katie Nanna had gone, for they had never liked her. She was old and fat and smelt of barley-water. Anything, they thought, would be better than Katie Nanna - if not much better.
    When the afternoon began to die away behind the Park, Mrs. Brill and Ellen came to give them their supper and to bath the Twins. And after supper Jane and Michael sat at the window watching for Mr. Banks to come home, and listening to the sound of the East Wind blowing through the naked branches of the cherry-trees in the Lane. The trees themselves, turning and bending in the half light, looked as though they had gone mad and were dancing their roots out of the ground. 
    "There he is!" said Michael, pointing suddenly to a shape that banged heavily against the gate. Jane peered through the gathering darkness. 
    "That's not Daddy," she said. "It's somebody else." 
    Then the shape, tossed and bent under the wind, lifted the latch of the gate, and they could see that it belonged to a woman, who was holding her hat on with one hand and carrying a bag in the other. As they watched, Jane and Michael saw a curious thing happen. As soon as the shape was inside the gate the wind seemed to catch her up into the air and fling her at the house. It was as though it had flung her first at the gate, waited for her to open it, and then had lifted and thrown her, bag and all, at the front door. The watching children heard a terrific bang, and as she landed the whole house shook.
    "How funny! I've never seen that happen before," said Michael.
    "Let's go and see who it is!" said Jane, and taking Michael's arm she drew him away from the window, through the Nursery and out on to the landing. From there they always had a good view of anything that happened in the front hall. 
    Presently they saw their Mother coming out of the drawing-roomwith a visitor following her. Jane and Michael could see that the newcomer had shiny black hair - "Rather like a wooden Duth doll," whispered Jane. And that she was thin, with large feet and hands, and small, rather peering blue eyes.
    "You'll find that they are very nice children," Mrs. Banks was saying.
    Michael's elbow gave a sharp dig at Jane's ribs. 
    "And that they give no trouble at all," continued Mrs. Banks uncertainly, as if she herself didn't really believe what she was saying. They  heard the visitor sniff as though she didn't either.
    "Now, about references --" Mrs. Banks went on.
    "Oh, I make it a rule never to give references," said the other firmly. Mrs. Banks stared. 
    "But I thought it was usual," she said. "I mean - I understood people always did."
    "A very old-fashioned idea, to my mind," Jane and Michael heard the stern voice say. "Very old-fashioned. Quite out of date, as you might say."
    Now, if there was one thing Mrs. Banks did not like, it was to be thought old-fashioned. She just couldn't bear it. So she said quickly: 
    "Very well, then. We won't bother about them. I only asked, of course, in case you - er - required it. The nursery is upstairs --" And she led the way towards the staircase, talking all the time, without stopping once. And because she was doing that Mrs. Banks did not notice what was happening behind her, but Jane and Michael, watching from the top landing, had an excellent view of the extraordinary thing the visitor now did.
    Certainly she followed Mrs. Banks upstairs, but not in the usual way. With her large bag in her hands she slid gracefully up the banisters, and arrived at the landing at the same time as Mrs. Banks. Such a thing, Jane and Michael knew, had never been done before. Down, of course, for they had often done it themselves. But up - never! They gazed curiously at the strange new visitor. 
    "Well, that's all settled, then." A sigh of relief came from the children's Mother. 
    "Quite. As long as I'm satisfied," said the other, wiping her nose with a large red and white bandanna handkerchief.
    "Why, children," said Mrs. Banks, noticing them suddenly, "what are you doing there? This is your new nurse, Mary Poppins. Jane, Michael, say how do you do! And these" - she waved her hand at the babies in their cots - "are the Twins."
    Mary Poppins regarded them steadily, looking from one to the other as though she were making up her mind whether she liked them or not. 
    "Will we do?" said Michael.
    "Michael, don't be naughty," said his Mother.
    Mary Poppins continued to regard the four children searchingly. Then, with a long, loud sniff that seemed to indicate that she had made up her mind, she said:
    "I'll take the position."
    "For all the world," as Mrs. Banks said to her husband later, "as though she were doing us a signal honour."
    "Perhaps she is," said Mr. Banks, putting his nose round the corner of the newspaper for a moment and then withdrawing it very quickly.
    When their Mother had gone, Jane and Michael edged towards Mary Poppins, who stood, still as a post, with her hands folded in front of her.
    "How did you come?" Jane asked. "It looked just as if the wind blew you here."
    "It did," said Mary Poppins briefly. And she proceeded to unwind her muffler from her neck and take off her hat, which she hung on one of the bedposts. 
    As it did not seem as though Mary Poppins were going to say any more - though she sniffed a great deal - Jane, too, remained silent. But when she bent down to undo her bag, Michael could not restrain himself.
    "What a funny bag!" he said, pinching it with his fingers.
    "Carpet," said Mary Poppins, putting her key in the lock.
    "To carry carpets in, you mean?"
    "No. Made of."
    "Oh," said Michael, "I see." But he didn't - quite. 
    By this time the bag was open, and Jane and Michael were more than surprised to find it was completely empty.
    "Why," said Jane, "there's nothing in it!"
    "What do you mean - nothing?" demanded Mary Poppins, drawing herself up and looking as though she had been insulted. "Nothing in it, did you say?"
    And with that she took out from the empty bag a starched white apron and tied it round her waist. Next she unpacked a large cake of Sunlight Soap, a toothbrush, a packet of hairpins, a bottle of scent, a small folding armchair and a box of throat lozenges.
    Jane and Michael stared.
    "But I saw," whispered Michael. "It was empty."
    "Hush!" said Jane, as Mary Poppins took out a large bottle labelled "One Tea-Spoon to be Taken at Bed-Time." 
    A spoon was attached to the neck of the bottle, and into this Mary Poppins poured a dark crimson fluid. 
    "Is that your medicine?" enquired Michael, looking very interested. 
    "No, yours," said Mary Poppins, holding out the spoon to him. Michael stared. He wrinkled up his nose. He began to protest. 
    "I don't want it. I don't need it. I won't!"
    But Mary Poppins's eyes were fixed upon him,and Michael suddenly discovered that you could not look at Mary Poppins and disobey her. There was something strange and extraordinary about her - something that was frightening and at the same time most exciting. The spoon came nearer. He held his breath, shut his eyes and gulped. A delicious taste ran round his mouth. He turned his tongue in it. He swallowed, and a happy smile ran round his face. 
    "Strawberry ice," he said ecstatically. "More, more, more!"
    But Mary Poppins, her face as stern as before, was pouring out a dose for Jane. It ran into the spoon, silvery, greeny, yellowy. Jane tasted it. 
    "Lime-juice cordial," she said, sliding her tongue deliciously over her lips. But when she saw Mary Poppins moving towards the Twins with the bottle Jane rushed at her.
    "Oh, no - please. They're too young. It wouldn't be good for them. Please!"
    Mary Poppins, however, took no notice, but with a warning, terrible glance at Jane, tipped the spoon towards John's mouth. He lapped it eagerly, and by the few drops that were spilt on his bib, Jane and Michael could tell that the substance in the spoon this time was milk. Then Barbara had her share, and she gurgled and licked the spoon twice.
    "Rum punch," she said, smacking her lips and corking the bottle. 
    Jane's eyes and Michael's popped with astonishment, but they were not given much time to wonder, for Mary Poppins, having put the miraculous bottle on the mantelpiece, turned to them. 
    "Now," she said, "spit-spot into bed." And she began to undress them. They noticed that whereas buttons and hooks had needed all sorts of coaxing from Katie Nanna, for Mary Poppins they flew apart almost at a look. In less than a minute they found themselves in bed and watching, by the dim light from the night-light, the rest of Mary Poppins's unpacking being performed. 
    From the carpet bag she took out seven flannel nightgowns, four cotton ones, a pair of boots, a set of dominoes, two bathing-caps and a postcard album. Last of all came a folding camp-bedstead with blankets and eiderdown complete, and this she set down between John's cot and Barbara's. 
    Jane and Michael sat hugging themselves and watching. It was all so surprising that they could find nothing to say. But they knew, both of them, that something strange and wonderful had happened at Number Seventeen, Cherry-Tree Lane.
    Mary Poppins, slipping one of the flannel nightgowns over her head, began to undress underneath it as though it were a tent. Michael, charmed by this strange new arrival, unable to keep silent any longer, called to her. 
    "Mary Poppins," he cried, "you'll never leave us, will you?"
    There was no reply from under the nightgown. Michael could not bear it. 
    "You won't leave us, will you?" he called anxiously. 
    Mary Poppins's head came out of the top of the nightgown. She looked very fierce. 
    "One word more from that direction," she said threateningly, "and I'll call the Policeman."
    "I was only saying," began Michael, meekly, "that we hoped you wouldn't be going away soon -- " He stopped, feeling very red and confused.
    Mary Poppins stared from him to Jane in silence. Then she sniffed. 
    "I'll stay till the wind changes," she said shortly, and she blew out her candle and got into bed. 
    "That's all right," said Michael, half to himself and half to Jane. But Jane wasn't listening. She was thinking about all that had happened, and wondering...
    
    And that is how Mary Poppins came to live at Number Seventeen, Cherry-Tree Lane. And although they sometimes found themselves wishing for the quieter, more ordinary days when Katie Nanna ruled the household, everybody, on the whole, was glad of Mary Poppins's arrival. Mr. Banks was glad because, as she arrived by herself and did not hold up the traffic, he had not had to tip the Policeman. Mrs. Banks was glad because she was able to tell everybody that her children's nurse was so fashionable that she didn't believe in giving references. Mrs. Brill and Ellen were glad because they could drink strong cups of tea all day in the kitchen and no longer needed to preside at nursery suppers. Robertson Ay was glad, too, because Mary Poppins had only one pair of shoes, and those she polished herself. 
    But nobody ever knew what Mary Poppins felt about it, for Mary Poppins never told anybody anything...
    NANCY DREW began peeling off her garden gloves as she ran up the porch steps
and into the hall to answer the ringing telephone. She picked it up and said,
"Hello!"
"Hi, Nancy! This is Helen." Although Helen Corning was nearly three years
older than Nancy, the two girls were close friends.
"Are you tied up on a case?" Helen asked.
"No. What's up? A mystery?"
"Yes—a haunted house."
Nancy sat down on the chair by the telephone. "Tell me more!" the
eighteen-year-old detective begged excitedly.
"You've heard me speak of my Aunt Rosemary," Helen began. "Since becoming a
widow, she has lived with her mother at Twin Elms, the old family mansion out
in Cliffwood. Well, I went to see them yesterday. They said that many strange,
mysterious things have been happening there recently. I told them how good you
are at solving mysteries, and they'd like you to come out to Twin Elms and
help them." Helen paused, out of breath.
"It certainly sounds intriguing," Nancy replied, her eyes dancing.
"If you're not busy, Aunt Rosemary and I would like to come over in about an
hour and talk to you about the ghost."
"I can't wait."
After Nancy had put down the phone, she sat lost in thought for several
minutes. Since solving The Secret of the Old Clock, she had longed for another
case. Here was her chance!
Attractive, blond-haired Nancy was brought out of her daydreaming by the sound
of the doorbell. At the same moment the Drews' housekeeper, Hannah Gruen, came
down the front stairs.
"I'll answer it," she offered.
Mrs. Gruen had lived with the Drews since Nancy was three years old. At that
time Mrs. Drew had passed away and Hannah had become like a second mother to
Nancy. There was a deep affection between the two, and Nancy confided all her
secrets to the understanding housekeeper.
Mrs. Gruen opened the door and instantly a man stepped into the hall. He was
short, thin, and rather stooped. Nancy guessed his age to be about forty.
"Is Mr. Drew at home?" he asked brusquely. "My name is Comber — Nathan
Comber."
"No, he's not here just now," the housekeeper replied.
The caller looked over Hannah Gruen's shoulder and stared at Nancy. "Are you
Nancy Drew?"

"Yes, I am.  Is there anything I can do for you?"
The man's shifty gaze moved from Nancy to Hannah. "I've come out of the
goodness of my heart to warn you and your father," he said pompously.
"Warn us? About what?" Nancy asked quickly.
Nathan Comber straightened up importantly and said, "Your father is in great
danger, Miss. Drew!"
Both Nancy and Hannah Gruen gasped. “You mean this very minute?" the
housekeeper questioned.
"All the time," was the startling answer. "I understand you're a pretty bright
girl, Miss Drew—that you even solve mysteries. Well, right now I advise you to
stick close to your father. Don't leave him for a minute."
Hannah Gruen looked as if she were ready to collapse and suggested that they
all go into the living room, sit down, and talk the matter over. When they
were seated, Nancy asked Nathan Gomber to explain further.
"The story in a nutshell is this," he began. "You know that your father was
brought in to do legal work for the railroad when it was buying property for
the new bridge here."
As Nancy nodded, he continued, "Well, a lot of the folks who sold their
property think they were gypped."
Nancy's face reddened. "I understood from my father that everyone was well
paid."
"That's not true," said Comber. "Besides, the railroad is in a real mess now.
One of the property owners, whose deed and signature they claim to have, says
that he never signed the contract of sale."
"What's his name?" Nancy asked.
"Willie Wharton."
Nancy had not heard her father mention this name. She asked Gomber to go on
with his story.
"I'm acting as agent for Willie Wharton and several of the land owners who
were his neighbors," he said, "and they can make it pretty tough for the
railroad. Willie Wharton's signature was never witnessed and the attached
certificate of acknowledgment was not notarized. That's good proof the
signature was a forgery. Well, if the railroad thinks they're going to get
away with this, they're not!"
Nancy frowned. Such a procedure on the part of the property owners meant
trouble for her father! She said evenly, "But all Willie Wharton has to do is
swear before a notary that he did sign the contract of sale."
Comber chuckled. "It's not that easy, Miss Drew. Willie Wharton is not
available. Some of us have a good idea where he is and we'll produce him at
the right time. But that time won't be until the railroad promises to give the
sellers more money. Then he'll sign. You see, Willie is a real kind man and he
wants to help his friends out whenever he can. Now he's got a chance."
Nancy had taken an instant dislike to Comber and now it was quadrupled. She
judged him to be the kind of person who stays within the boundaries of the law
but whose ethics are questionable. This was indeed a tough problem for Mr.
Drew!
"Who are the people who are apt to harm my father?" she asked.
"I'm not saying who they are," Nathan Comber retorted. "You don't seem very
appreciative of my coming here to warn you. Fine kind of a daughter you are.
You don't care what happens to your father!"
Annoyed by the man's insolence, both Nancy and Mrs. Gruen angrily stood up.
The housekeeper, pointing toward the front door, said, "Good day, Mr. Gomber!"
The caller shrugged as he too arose. "Have it your own way, but don't say I
didn't warn you!"
He walked to the front door, opened it, and as he went outside, closed it with
a tremendous bang.
"Well, of all the insulting people!" Hannah snorted.
Nancy nodded. "But that's not the worst of it, Hannah darling. I think there's
more to Comber's warning than he is telling. It seems to me to imply a threat.
And he almost has me convinced. Maybe I should stay close to Dad until he and

the other lawyers have straightened out this railroad tangle."
She said this would mean giving up a case she had been asked to take. Hastily
Nancy gave Hannah the highlights of her conversation with Helen about the
haunted mansion. "Helen and her aunt will be here in a little while to tell us
the whole story."
"Oh, maybe things aren't so serious for your father as that horrible man made
out," Hannah said encouragingly. "If I were you I'd listen to the details
about the haunted house and then decide what you want to do about the
mystery."
In a short time a sports car pulled into the winding, tree-shaded driveway of
the Drew home. The large brick house was set some distance back from the
street.
Helen was at the wheel and stopped just beyond the front entrance. She helped
her aunt from the car and they came up the steps together. Mrs. Rosemary Hayes
was tall and slender and had graying hair. Her face had a gentle expression
but she looked tired.
Helen introduced her aunt to Nancy and to Hannah, and the group went into the
living room to sit down. Hannah offered to prepare tea and left the room.
"Oh, Nancy!' said Helen, "I do hope you can take Aunt Rosemary and Miss
Flora's case." Quickly she explained that Miss Flora was her aunt's mother.
"Aunt Rosemary is really my great-aunt and Miss Flora is my great-grandmother.
From the time she was a little girl everybody has called her Miss Flora."
"The name may seem odd to people the first time they hear it," Mrs. Hayes
remarked, "but we're all so used to it, we never think anything about it."
"Please tell me more about your house," Nancy requested, smiling.
"Mother and I are almost nervous wrecks," Mrs. Hayes replied. "I have urged
her to leave Twin Elms, but she won't. You see, Mother has lived there ever
since she married my father, Everett Turnbull."
Mrs. Hayes went on to say that all kinds of strange happenings had occurred
during the past couple of weeks. They had heard untraceable music, thumps and
creaking noises at night, and had seen eerie, indescribable shadows on walls.
"Have you notified the police?" Nancy asked.
"Oh, yes," Mrs. Hayes answered. "But after talking with my mother, they came
to the conclusion that most of what she saw and heard could be explained by
natural causes. The rest, they said, probably was imagination on her part. You
see, she's over eighty years old, and while I know her mind is sound and
alert, I'm afraid that the police don't think so."
After a pause Mrs. Hayes went on, "I had almost talked myself into thinking
the ghostly noises could be attributed to natural causes, when something else
happened."
"What was that?" Nancy questioned eagerly.
"We were robbed! During the night several pieces of old jewelry were taken. I
did telephone the police about this and they came to the house for a
description of the pieces. But they still would not admit that a ghost1y
visitor had taken them."
Nancy was thoughtful for several seconds before making a comment. Then she
said, "Do the police have any idea who the thief might be?"
Aunt Rosemary shook her head. "No. And I'm afraid we might have more
burglaries."
Many ideas were running through Nancy's head. One was that the thief
apparently had no intention of harming anyone—that his only motive had been
burglary. Was he or was he not the person who was "haunting" the house? Or
could the strange happenings have some natural explanations, as the police had
suggested?
At this moment Hannah returned with a large silver tray on which was a tea
service and some dainty sandwiches. She set the tray on a table and asked
Nancy to pour the tea. She herself passed the cups of tea and sandwiches to
the callers.
As they ate, Helen said, "Aunt Rosemary hasn't told you half the things that
have happened. Once Miss Flora thought she saw someone sliding out of a

fireplace at midnight, and another time a chair moved from one side of the
room to the other while her back was turned. But no one was there!"
"How extraordinary!" Hannah Gruen exclaimed. "I've often read about such
things, but I never thought I'd meet anyone who lived in a haunted house."
Helen turned to Nancy and gazed pleadingly at her friend. "You see how much
you're needed at Twin Elms? Won't you please go out there with me and solve
the mystery of the ghost?"
The Mysterious Mishap
SIPPING their tea, Helen Corning and her aunt waited for Nancy's decision. The
young sleuth was in a dilemma. She wanted to start at once solving the mystery
of the "ghost" of Twin Elms. But Nathan Comber's warning still rang in her
ears and she felt that her first duty was to stay with her father.
At last she spoke.  "'Mrs. Hayes—" she began.
"Please call me Aunt Rosemary," the caller requested. "All Helen's friends
do."
Nancy smiled. "I'd love to. Aunt Rosemary, may I please let you know tonight
or tomorrow? I really must speak to my father about the case. And something
else came up just this afternoon which may keep me at home for a while at
least."
"I understand," Mrs. Hayes answered, trying to conceal her disappointment.
Helen Corning did not take Nancy's announcement so calmly. "Oh, Nancy, you
just must come. I'm sure your dad would want you to help us. Can't you
postpone the other thing until you get back?"
"I'm afraid not," said Nancy. "I can't tell you all the details, but Dad has
been threatened and I feel that I ought to stay close to him."
Hannah Gruen added her fears. "Goodness only knows what they may do to Mr.
Drew," she said. "Somebody could come up and hit him on the head, or poison
his food in a restaurant, or—"
Helen and her aunt gasped. "It's that bad?" Helen asked, her eyes growing
wide.
Nancy explained that she would talk to her father when he returned home. "I
hate to disappoint you," she said, "but you can see what a quandary I'm in."
"You poor girl!" said Mrs. Hayes sympathetically. "Now don't you worry about
us."
Nancy smiled. "I'll worry whether I come or not," she said. "Anyway, I'll talk
to my dad tonight."
The callers left shortly. When the door had closed behind them, Hannah put an
arm around Nancy's shoulders. "I'm sure everything will come out all right for
everybody," she said. "I'm sorry I talked about those dreadful things that
might happen to your father. I let my imagination run away with me, just like
they say Miss Flora's does with her."
"You're a great comfort, Hannah dear," said Nancy. "To tell the truth, I have
thought of all kinds of horrible things myself." She began to pace the floor.
"I wish Dad would get home."
During the next hour she went to the window at least a dozen times, hoping to
see her father's car coming up the street It was not until six o'clock that
she heard the crunch of wheels on the driveway and saw Mr. Drew's sedan pull
into the garage.
"He's safe!" she cried out to Hannah, who was testing potatoes that were
baking in the oven.
In a flash Nancy was out the back door and running to meet her father. "Oh,
Dad, I'm so glad to see you!" she exclaimed.
She gave him a tremendous hug and a resounding kiss. He responded
affectionately, but gave a little chuckle. "What have I done to rate this
extra bit of attention?" he teased. With a wink he added, "I know. Your date
for tonight is off and you want me to substitute."
"Oh, Dad," Nancy replied. "Of course my date's not off. But I'm just about to
call it off."
"Why?" Mr. Drew questioned. "Isn't Dirk going to stay on your list?"

"It's not that," Nancy replied. "It's because— because you're in terrible
danger, Dad. I've been warned not to leave you."
Instead of looking alarmed, the lawyer burst out laughing. "In terrible danger
of what? Are you going to make a raid on my wallet?"
"Dad, be serious! I really mean what I'm saying. Nathan Comber was here and
told me that you're in great danger and I'd better stay with you at all
times."
The lawyer sobered at once. "That pest again!" he exclaimed. "There are times
when I'd like to thrash the man till he begged for mercy!"
Mr. Drew suggested that they postpone their discussion about Nathan Comber
until dinner was over. Then he would tell his daughter the true facts in the
case. After they had finished dinner, Hannah insisted upon tidying up alone
while father and daughter talked.
"I will admit that there is a bit of a muddle about the railroad bridge," Mr.
Drew began. "What happened was that the lawyer who went to get Willie
Wharton's signature was very ill at the time. Unfortunately, he failed to have
the signature witnessed or have the attached certificate of acknowledgment
executed. The poor man passed away a few hours later."
"And the other railroad lawyers failed to notice that the signature hadn't
been witnessed or the certificate notarized?" Nancy asked.
"Not right away. The matter did not come to light until the man's widow turned
his brief case over to the railroad. The old deed to Wharton's property was
there, so the lawyers assumed that the signature on the contract was genuine.
The contract for the railroad bridge was awarded and work began. Suddenly
Nathan Comber appeared, saying he represented Willie Wharton and others who
had owned property which the railroad had bought on either side of the Muskoka
River."
"I understood from Mr. Comber," said Nancy, "that Willie Wharton is trying to
get more money for his neighbors by holding out for a higher price himself."
"That's the story. Personally, I think it's a sharp deal on Comber's part. The
more people he can get money for, the higher his commission," Mr. Drew stated.
"What a mess!" Nancy exclaimed. "And what can be done?"
"To tell the truth, there is little anyone can do until Willie Wharton is
found. Comber knows this, of course, and has probably advised Wharton to stay
in hiding until the railroad agrees to give everybody more money."
Nancy had been watching her father intently. Now she saw an expression of
eagerness come over his face. He leaned forward in his chair and said, "But I
think I'm about to outwit Mr. Nathan Comber. I've had a tip that Willie
Wharton is in Chicago and I'm leaving Monday morning to find out."
Mr. Drew went on, "I believe that Wharton will say he did sign the contract of
sale which the railroad company has and will readily consent to having the
certificate of acknowledgment notarized. Then, of course, the railroad won't
pay him or any of the other property owners another cent."
"But, Dad, you still haven't convinced me you're not in danger," Nancy
reminded him.
"Nancy dear," her father replied, "I feel that I am not in danger. Comber is
nothing but a blow-hard. I doubt that he or Willie Wharton or any of the other
property owners would resort to violence to keep me from working on this case.
He's just trying to scare me into persuading the railroad to accede to his
demands."
Nancy looked skeptical.. "But don't forget that you're about to go to Chicago
and produce the very man Comber and those property owners don't want around
here just now."
"I know." Mr. Drew nodded. "But I still doubt if anyone would use force to
keep me from going." Laughingly the lawyer added, "So I won't need you as a
bodyguard, Nancy."
His daughter gave a sigh of resignation. "All right, Dad, you know best." She
then proceeded to tell her father about the Twin Elms mystery, which she had
been asked to solve. "If you approve," Nancy said in conclusion, "I'd like to
go over there with Helen."

Mr. Drew had listened with great interest. Now, after a few moments of
thought, he smiled. "Go by all means, Nancy. I realize you've been itching to
work on a new case—and this sounds like a real challenge. But please be
careful."
"Oh, I will, Dad!" Nancy promised, her face lighting up. "Thanks a million."
She jumped from her chair, gave her father a kiss, then went to phone Helen
the good news. It was arranged that the girls would go to Twin Elms on Monday
morning.
Nancy returned to the living room, eager to discuss the mystery further. Her
father, however, glanced at his wrist watch. "Say, young lady, you'd better go
dress for that date of yours." He winked. "I happen to know that Dirk doesn't
like to be kept waiting."
"Especially by any of my mysteries." She laughed and hurried upstairs to
change into a dance dress.
Half an hour later Dirk Jackson arrived. Nancy and the red-haired, former
high-school tennis champion drove off to pick up another couple and attend an
amateur play and dance given by the local Little Theater group.
Nancy thoroughly enjoyed herself and was sorry when the affair ended. With the
promise of another date as soon as she returned from Twin Elms, Nancy said
good night and waved from her doorway to the departing boy. As she prepared
for bed, she thought of the play, the excellent orchestra, how lucky she was
to have Dirk for a date, and what fun it had all been. But then her thoughts
turned to Helen Corning and her relatives in the haunted house, Twin Elms.
"I can hardly wait for Monday to come," she murmured to herself as she fell
asleep.
The following morning she and her father attended church together. Hannah said
she was going to a special service that afternoon and therefore would stay at
home during the morning.
"I'll have a good dinner waiting for you," she announced, as the Drews left.
After the service was over, Mr. Drew said he would like to drive down to the
waterfront and see what progress had been made on the new bridge. "The
railroad is going ahead with construction on the far side of the river," he
told Nancy.
"Is the Wharton property on this side?" Nancy asked.
"Yes. And I must get to the truth of this mixed-up situation, so that work can
be started on this side too."
Mr. Drew wound among the many streets leading down to the Muskoka River, then
took the vehicular bridge across. He turned toward the construction area and
presently parked his car. As he and Nancy stepped from the sedan, he looked
ruefully at her pumps.
"It's going to be rough walking down to the waterfront," he said. "Perhaps you
had better wait here."
"Oh, I'll be all right," Nancy assured him. "I'd like to see what's being
done."
Various pieces of large machinery stood about on the high ground—a crane, a
derrick, and hydraulic shovels. As the Drews walked toward the river, they
passed a large truck. It faced the river and stood at the top of an incline
just above two of the four enormous concrete piers which had already been
built.
"I suppose there will be matching piers on the opposite side," Nancy mused, as
she and her father reached the riverbank. They paused in the space between the
two huge abutments. Mr. Drew glanced from side to side as if he had heard
something. Suddenly Nancy detected a noise behind them.
Turning, she was horrified to see that the big truck was moving toward them.
No one was at the wheel and the great vehicle was gathering speed at every
moment.
"Dad!" she screamed.
In the brief second of warning, the truck almost seemed to leap toward the
water. Nancy and her father, hemmed in by the concrete piers, had no way to
escape being run down.

"Dive!" Mr. Drew ordered.
Without hesitation, he and Nancy made running flat dives into the water, and
with arms flailing and legs kicking, swam furiously out of harm's way.
The truck thundered into the water and sank immediately up to the cab. The
Drews turned and came back to the shore.
"Whew! That was a narrow escape!" the lawyer exclaimed, as he helped his
daughter retrieve her pumps which had come off in the oozy bank. "And what
sights we are!" Nancy remarked.
"Indeed we are," her father agreed, as they trudged up the incline. "I'd like
to get hold of the workman who was careless enough to leave that heavy truck
on the slope without the brake on properly."
Nancy was not so sure that the near accident was the fault of a careless
workman. Nathan Comber had warned her that Mr. Drew's life was in danger. The
threat might already have been put into action!
A Stolen Necklace
"WE'D better get home in a hurry and change our clothes," said Mr. Drew. "And
I'll call the contracting company to tell them what happened."
"And notify the police?" Nancy suggested.
She dropped behind her father and gazed over the surrounding ground for
telltale footprints. Presently she saw several at the edge of the spot where
the truck had stood.
"Dad!" the young sleuth called out. "I may have found a clue to explain how
that truck started downhill."
Her father came back and looked at the footprints. They definitely had not
been made by a workman's boots.
"You may think me an old worrier, Dad," Nancy spoke up, "but these footprints,
made by a man's business shoes, convince me that somebody deliberately tried
to injure us with that truck."
The lawyer stared at his daughter. Then he looked down at the ground. From the
size of the shoe and the length of the stride one could easily perceive that
the wearer of the shoes was not tall. Nancy asked her father if he thought one
of the workmen on the project could be responsible.
"I just can't believe anyone associated with the contracting company would
want to injure us," Mr. Drew said.
Nancy reminded her father of Nathan Comber's warning. "It might be one of the
property owners, or even Willie Wharton himself."
"Wharton is short and has a small foot," the lawyer conceded. "And I must
admit that these look like fresh footprints. As a matter of fact, they show
that whoever was here ran off in a hurry. He may have released the brake on
the truck, then jumped out and run away."
"Yes," said Nancy. "And that means the attack was deliberate."
Mr. Drew did not reply. He continued walking up the hill, lost in thought.
Nancy followed and they climbed into the car. They drove home in silence, each
puzzling over the strange incident of the runaway truck. Upon reaching the
house, they were greeted by a loud exclamation of astonishment.
"My goodness!" Hannah Gruen cried out. "Whatever in the world happened to
you?"
They explained hastily, then hurried upstairs to bathe and change into dry
clothes. By the time they reached the first floor again, Hannah had placed
sherbet glasses filled with orange and grapefruit slices on the table. All
during the delicious dinner of spring lamb, rice and mushrooms, fresh peas and
chocolate angel cake with vanilla ice cream, the conversation revolved around
the railroad bridge mystery and then the haunted Twin Elms mansion.
"I knew things wouldn't be quiet around here for long," Hannah Gruen remarked
with a smile. "Tomorrow you'll both be off on big adventures. I certainly wish
you both success."
"Thank you, Hannah," said Nancy. She laughed. "I'd better get a good night's
sleep. From now on I may be kept awake by ghosts and strange noises."
"I'm a little uneasy about your going to Twin Elms," the housekeeper told her.

"Please promise me that you'll be careful."
"Of course," Nancy replied. Turning to her father, she said, "Pretend I've
said the same thing to you about being careful."
The lawyer chuckled and pounded his chest. "You know me. I can be pretty tough
when the need arises."
Early the next morning Nancy drove her father to the airport in her blue
convertible. Just before she kissed him good-by at the turnstile, he said, "I
expect to return on Wednesday, Nancy. Suppose I stop off at Cliffwood and see
how you're making out?"
"Wonderful, Dad! I'll be looking for you."
As soon as her father left, Nancy drove directly to Helen Coming's home. The
pretty, brunette girl came from the front door of the white cottage, swinging
a suitcase. She tossed it into the rear of Nancy's convertible and climbed in.
"I ought to be scared," said Helen. "Goodness only knows what's ahead of us.
But right now I'm so happy nothing could upset me."
"What happened?" Nancy asked as she started the car. "Did you inherit a
million?"
"Something better than that," Helen replied. "Nancy, I want to tell you a big,
big secret. I'm going to be married!"
Nancy slowed the car and pulled to the side of the street. Leaning over to hug
her friend, she said, "Why, Helen, how wonderful! Who is he? And tell me all
about it. This is rather sudden, isn't it?"
"Yes, it is," Helen confessed. "His name is Jim Archer and he's simply out of
this world. I'm a pretty lucky girl. I met him a couple of months ago when he
was home on a short vacation. He works for the Tristam Oil Company and has
spent two years abroad. Jim will be away a while longer, and then be given a
position here in the States."
As Nancy started the car up once more, her eyes twinkled. "Helen Corning, have
you been engaged for two months and didn't tell me?"
Helen shook her head. "Jim and I have been corresponding ever since he left.
Last night he telephoned from overseas and asked me to marry him." Helen
giggled. "I said yes in a big hurry. Then he asked to speak to Dad. My father
gave his consent but insisted that our engagement not be announced until Jim's
return to this country."
The two girls discussed all sorts of delightful plans for Helen's wedding and
before they knew it they had reached the town of Cliffwood.
"My great-grandmother's estate is about two miles out of town," Helen said.
"Go down Main Street and turn right at the fork."
Ten minutes later she pointed out Twin Elms, From the road one could see
little of the house. A high stone wall ran along the front of the estate and
beyond it were many tall trees. Nancy turned into the driveway which twisted
and wound among elms, oaks, and maples.
Presently the old Colonial home came into view. Helen said it had been built
in 1785 and had been given its name because of the two elm trees which stood
at opposite ends of the long building. They had grown to be giants and their
foliage was beautiful. The mansion was of red brick and nearly all the walls
were covered with ivy. There was a ten-foot porch with tall white pillars at
the huge front door.
"It's charming!" Nancy commented as she pulled up to the porch.
"Wait until you see the grounds," said Helen. "There are several old, old
buildings. An icehouse, a smokehouse, a kitchen, and servants' cottages."
"The mansion certainly doesn't look spooky from the outside," Nancy commented.
At that moment the great door opened and Aunt Rosemary came outside. "Hello,
girls," she greeted them. "I'm so glad to see you."
Nancy felt the warmness of the welcome but thought that it was tinged with
worry. She wondered if another "ghost" incident had taken place at the
mansion.
The girls took their suitcases from the car and followed Mrs. Hayes inside.
Although the furnishings looked rather worn, they were still very beautiful.
The high-ceilinged rooms opened off a center hall and in a quick glance Nancy

saw lovely damask draperies, satin-covered sofas and chairs, and on the walls,
family portraits in large gilt frames of scrollwork design.
Aunt Rosemary went to the foot of the shabbily carpeted stairway, took hold of
the handsome mahogany balustrade, and called, "Mother, the girls are here!"
In a moment a slender, frail-looking woman with snow-white hair started to
descend the steps. Her face, though older in appearance than Rosemary's, had
the same gentle smile. As Miss Flora reached the foot of the stairs, she held
out her hands to both girls.
At once Helen said, "I'd like to present Nancy Drew, Miss Flora."
"I'm so glad you could come, my dear," the elderly woman said. "I know that
you're going to solve this mystery which has been bothering Rosemary and me.
I'm sorry not to be able to entertain you more auspiciously, but a haunted
house hardly lends itself to gaiety."
The dainty, yet stately, Miss Flora swept toward a room which she referred to
as the parlor. It was opposite the library. She sat down in a high-backed
chair and asked everyone else to be seated.
"Mother," said Aunt Rosemary, "we don't have to be so formal with Nancy and
Helen. I'm sure they'll understand that we've just been badly frightened." She
turned toward the girls. "Something happened a little while ago that has made
us very jittery."
"Yes," Miss Flora said. "A pearl necklace of mine was stolen!"
"You don't mean the lovely one that has been in the family so many years!"
Helen cried out.
The two women nodded. Then Miss Flora said, "Oh, I probably was very foolish.
It's my own fault. While I was in my room, I took the necklace from the hiding
place where I usually keep it. The catch had not worked well the last time I
wore the pearls and I wanted to examine it. While I was doing this, Rosemary
called to me to come downstairs. The gardener was here and wanted to talk
about some work. I put the necklace in my dresser drawer. When I returned ten
minutes later the necklace wasn't there!"
"How dreadful!" said Nancy sympathetically. "Had anybody come into the house
during that time?"
"Not to our knowledge," Aunt Rosemary replied. "Ever since we've had this
ghost visiting us we've kept every door and window on the first floor locked
all the time."
Nancy asked if the two women had gone out into the garden to speak to their
helper. "Mother did," said Mrs. Hayes. "But I was in the kitchen the entire
time. If anyone came in the back door, I certainly would have seen the
person."
"Is there a back stairway to the second floor?" Nancy asked.
"Yes," Miss Flora answered. "But there are doors at both top and bottom and we
keep them locked. No one could have gone up that way."
"Then anyone who came into the house had to go up by way of the front stairs?"
"Yes." Aunt Rosemary smiled a little. "But if anyone had, I would have
noticed. You probably heard how those stairs creak when Mother came down. This
can be avoided if you hug the wall, but practically no one knows that,"
"May I go upstairs and look around?" Nancy questioned.
"Of course, dear. And I'll show you and Helen to your room," Aunt Rosemary
said.
The girls picked up their suitcases and followed the two women up the stairs.
Nancy and Helen were given a large, quaint room at the front of the old house
over the library. They quickly deposited their luggage, then Miss Flora led
the way across the hall to her room, which was directly above the parlor. It
was large and very attractive with its canopied mahogany bed and an
old-fashioned candlewick spread. The dresser, dressing table, and chairs also
were mahogany. Long chintz draperies hung at the windows.
An eerie feeling began to take possession of Nancy. She could almost feel the
presence of a ghostly burglar on the premises. Though she tried to shake off
the mood, it persisted. Finally she told herself that it was possible the
thief was still around. If so, he must be hiding.

Against one wall stood a large walnut wardrobe. Helen saw Nancy gazing at it
intently. She went over and whispered, "Do you think there might be someone
inside?"
"Who knows?" Nancy replied in a low voice. "Let's find out!"
She walked across the room, and taking hold of the two knobs on the double
doors, opened them wide.
Strange Music
THE ANXIOUS group stared inside the wardrobe. No one stood there. Dresses,
suits, and coats hung in an orderly row.
Nancy took a step forward and began separating them. Someone, she thought,
might be hiding behind the clothes. The others in the room held their breaths
as she made a thorough search.
"No one here!" she finally announced, and a sigh of relief escaped the lips of
Miss Flora and Aunt Rosemary.
The young sleuth said she would like to make a thorough inspection of all
possible hiding places on the second floor. With Helen helping her, they went
from room to room, opening wardrobe doors and looking under beds. They did not
find the thief.
Nancy suggested that Miss Flora and Aunt Rosemary report the theft to the
police, but the older woman shook her head. Mrs. Hayes, although she agreed
this might be wise, added softly, "Mother just might be mistaken. She's a
little forgetful at times about where she puts things."
With this possibility in mind, she and the girls looked in every drawer in the
room, under the mattress and pillows, and even in the pockets of Miss Flora's
clothes. The pearl necklace was not found. Nancy suggested that she and Helen
try to find out how the thief had made his entrance.
Helen led the way outdoors. At once Nancy began to look for footprints. No
tracks were visible on the front or back porches, or on any of the walks,
which were made of finely crushed stone.
"We'll look in the soft earth beneath the windows," Nancy said. "Maybe the
thief climbed in."
"But Aunt Rosemary said all the windows on the first floor are kept locked,"
Helen objected.
"No doubt," Nancy said. "But I think we should look for footprints just the
same."
The girls went from window to window, but there were no footprints beneath
any. Finally Nancy stopped and looked thoughtfully at the ivy on the walls.
"Do you think the thief climbed up to the second floor that way?" Helen asked
her. "But there'd still be footprints on the ground."
Nancy said that the thief could have carried a plank with him, laid it down,
and stepped from the walk to the wall of the house. "Then he could have
climbed up the ivy and down again, and gotten back to the walk without leaving
any footprints."
Once more Nancy went around the entire house, examining every bit of ivy which
wound up from the foundation. Finally she said, "No, the thief didn't get into
the house this way."
"Well, he certainly didn't fly in," said Helen. "So how did he enter?"
Nancy laughed. "If I could tell you that I'd have the mystery half solved."
She said that she would like to look around the grounds of Twin Elms. "It may
give us a clue as to how the thief got into the house."
As they strolled along, Nancy kept a sharp lookout but saw nothing suspicious.
At last they came to a half-crumbled brick walk laid out in an interesting
crisscross pattern.
"Where does this walk lead?" Nancy asked.
"Well, I guess originally it went over to Riverview Manor, the next property,"
Helen replied. "I'll show you that mansion later. The first owner was a
brother of the man who built this place."
Helen went on to say that Riverview Manor was a duplicate of Twin Elms
mansion. The two brothers had been inseparable companions, but their sons who

later lived there had had a violent quarrel and had become lifelong enemies.
"Riverview Manor has been sold several times during the years but has been
vacant for a long time."
"You mean no one lives there now?" Nancy asked. As Helen nodded, she added
with a laugh, "Then maybe that's the ghost's home!"
"In that case he really must be a ghost," said Helen lightly. "There's not a
piece of furniture in the house."
The two girls returned to the Twin Elms mansion and reported their lack of
success in picking up a clue to the intruder. Nancy, recalling that many
Colonial houses had secret entrances and passageways, asked Miss Flora, "Do
you know of any secret entrance to your home that the thief could use?"
She said no, and explained that her husband had been a rather reticent person
and had passed away when Rosemary was only a baby. "It's just possible he knew
of a secret entrance, but did not want to worry me by telling me about it,"
Mrs. Turnbull said.
Aunt Rosemary, sensing that her mother was becoming alarmed by the questions,
suggested that they all have lunch. The two girls went with her to the kitchen
and helped prepare a tasty meal of chicken salad, biscuits, and fruit gelatin.
During the meal the conversation covered several subjects, but always came
back to the topic of the mystery. They had just finished eating when suddenly
Nancy sat straight up in her chair.
"What's the matter?" Helen asked her.
Nancy was staring out the dining-room door toward the stairway in the hall.
Then she turned to Miss Flora. "Did you leave a radio on in your bedroom?"
"Why, no."
"Did you, Aunt Rosemary?"
"No. Neither Mother nor I turned our radios on this morning. Why do—" She
stopped speaking, for now all of them could distinctly hear music coming from
the second floor.
Helen and Nancy were out of their chairs instantly. They dashed into the hall
and up the stairway. The music was coming from Miss Flora's room, and when the
girls rushed in, they knew indeed that it was from her radio.
Nancy went over to examine the set. It was an old one and did not have a clock
attachment with an automatic control.
"Someone came into this room and turned on the radio!" she stated.
A look of alarm came over Helen's face, but she tried to shake off her
nervousness and asked, "Nancy, do you think the radio could have been turned
on by remote control? I've heard of such things."
Nancy said she doubted this. "I'm afraid, Helen, that the thief has been in
the house all the time. He and the ghost are one and the same person. Oh, I
wish we had looked before in the cellar and the attic. Maybe it's not too
late. Come on!"
Helen, instead of moving from the room, stared at the fireplace. "Nancy," she
said, "do you suppose someone is hiding up there?"
Without hesitation she crossed the room, got down on her knees, and tried to
look up the chimney. The damper was closed. Reaching her arm up, Helen pulled
the handle to open it.
The next moment she cried out, "Ugh!"
"Oh, Helen, you poor thing!" Nancy exclaimed, running to her friend's side.
A shower of soot had come down, covering Helen's hair, face, shoulders, and
arms.
"Get me a towel, will you, Nancy?" she requested.
Nancy dashed to the bathroom and grabbed two large towels. She wrapped them
around her friend, then went with Helen to help her with a shampoo and general
cleanup job. Finally Nancy brought her another sports dress.
"I guess my idea about chimneys wasn't so good," Helen stated ruefully. "And
we're probably too late to catch the thief."
Nevertheless, she and Nancy climbed the stairs to the attic and looked behind
trunks and boxes to see if anyone were hiding. Next, the girls went to the
cellar and inspected the various rooms there. Still there was no sign of the

thief who had entered Twin Elms.
After Miss Flora had heard the whole story, she gave a nervous sigh. "It's the
ghost—there's no other explanation."
"But why," Aunt Rosemary asked, "has a ghost suddenly started performing here?
This house has been occupied since 1785 and no ghost was ever reported
haunting the place."
"Well, apparently robbery is the motive," Nancy replied. "But why the thief
bothers to frighten you is something I haven't figured out yet."
"The main thing," Helen spoke up, "is to catch him!"
"Oh, if we only could!" Miss Flora said, her voice a bit shaky.
The girls were about to pick up the luncheon dishes from the table, to carry
them to the kitchen, when the front door knocker sounded loudly.
"Oh, dear," said Miss Flora, "who can that be? Maybe it's the thief and he's
come to harm us!"
Aunt Rosemary put an arm around her mother's shoulders. "Please don't worry,"
she begged. "I think our caller is probably the man who wants to buy Twin
Elms." She turned to Nancy and Helen. "But Mother doesn't want to sell for the
low price that he is offering."
Nancy said she would go to the door. She set the dishes down and walked out to
the hall. Reaching the great door, she flung it open.
Nathan Comber stood there!
A Puzzling Interview
FOR SEVERAL seconds Nathan Comber stared at Nancy in disbelief. "You!" he
cried out finally.
"You didn't expect to find me here, did you?" she asked coolly.
"I certainly didn't. I thought you'd taken my advice and stayed with your
father. Young people today are so hardhearted!" Comber wagged his head in
disgust.
Nancy ignored Comber's remarks. Shrugging, the man pushed his way into the
hall. "I know this. If anything happens to your father, you'll never forgive
yourself. But you can't blame Nathan Comber! I warned you!"
Still Nancy made no reply. She kept looking at him steadily, trying to figure
out what was really in his mind. She was convinced it was not solicitude for
her father.
Nathan Comber changed the subject abruptly.
"I'd like to see Mrs. Turnbull and Mrs. Hayes," he said. "Go call them."
Nancy was annoyed by Comber's crudeness, but she turned around and went down
the hall to the dining room.
"We heard every word," Miss Flora said in a whisper. "I shan't see Mr. Comber.
I don't want to sell this house."
Nancy was amazed to hear this. "You mean he's the person who wants to buy it?"
"Yes."
Instantly Nancy was on the alert. Because of the nature of the railroad deal
in which Nathan Comber was involved, she was distrustful of his motives in
wanting to buy Twin Elms. It flashed through her mind that perhaps he was
trying to buy it at a very low price and planned to sell it off in building
lots at a huge profit.
"Suppose I go tell him you don't want to sell," Nancy suggested in a low
voice.
But her caution was futile. Hearing footsteps behind her, she turned to see
Comber standing in the doorway.
"Howdy, everybody!" he said.
Miss Flora, Aunt Rosemary, and Helen showed annoyance. It was plain that all
of them thought the man completely lacking in good manners.
Aunt Rosemary's jaw was set in a grim line, but she said politely, "Helen,
this is Mr. Comber. Mr. Comber, my niece, Miss Corning."
"Pleased to meet you," said their caller, extending a hand to shake Helen's.
"Nancy, I guess you've met Mr. Comber," Aunt Rosemary went on.
"Oh, sure!" Nathan Comber said with a somewhat raucous laugh. "Nancy and me,

we've met!"
"Only once," Nancy said pointedly.
Ignoring her rebuff, he went on, "Nancy Drew is a very strange young lady. Her
father's in great danger and I tried to warn her to stick close to him.
Instead of that, she's out here visiting you folks."
"Her father's in danger?" Miss Flora said worriedly.
"Dad says he's not," Nancy replied. "And besides, I'm sure my father would
know how to take care of any enemies." She looked straight at Nathan Comber,
as if to let him know that the Drews were not easily frightened.
"Well," the caller said, "let's get down to business." He pulled an envelope
full of papers from his pocket. "Everything's here—all ready for you to sign,
Mrs. Turnbull."
"I don't wish to sell at such a low figure," Miss Flora told him firmly. "In
fact, I don't know that I want to sell at all."
Nathan Comber tossed his head. "You'll sell all right," he prophesied. "I've
been talking to some of the folks downtown. Everybody knows this old place is
haunted and nobody would give you five cents for it—that is, nobody but me."
As he waited for his words to sink in, Nancy spoke up, "If the house is
haunted, why do you want it?"
"Well," Comber answered, "I guess I'm a gambler at heart. I'd be willing to
put some money into this place, even if there is a ghost parading around." He
laughed loudly, then went on, "I declare it might be a real pleasure to meet a
ghost and get the better of it!"
Nancy thought with disgust, "Nathan Comber, you're about the most conceited,
obnoxious person I've met in a long time."
Suddenly the expression of cunning on the man's face changed completely. An
almost wistful look came into his eyes. He sat down on one of the dining-room
chairs and rested his chin in his hand.
"I guess you think I'm just a hardheaded business man with no feelings," he
said. "The truth is I'm a real softy. I'll tell you why I want this old house
so bad. I've always dreamed of owning a Colonial mansion, and having a kinship
with early America. You see, my family were poor folks in Europe. Now that
I've made a little money, I'd like to have a home like this to roam around in
and enjoy its traditions."
Miss Flora seemed to be touched by Comber's story. "I had no idea you wanted
the place so much," she said kindly. "Maybe I ought to give it up. It's really
too big for us."
As Aunt Rosemary saw her mother weakening, she said quickly, "You don't have
to sell this house, Mother. You know you love it. So far as the ghost is
concerned, I'm sure that mystery is going to be cleared up. Then you'd be
sorry you had parted with Twin Elms. Please don't say yes!"
As Comber gave Mrs. Hayes a dark look, Nancy asked him, "Why don't you buy
Riverview Manor? It's a duplicate of this place and is for sale. You probably
could purchase it at a lower price than you could this one."
"I've seen that place," the man returned. "It's in a bad state. It would cost
me a mint of money to fix it up. No sir. I want this place and I'm going to
have it!"
This bold remark was too much for Aunt Rosemary. Her eyes blazing, she said,
"Mr. Comber, this interview is at an end. Good-by!"
To Nancy's delight and somewhat to her amusement, Nathan Comber obeyed the
"order" to leave. He seemed to be almost meek as he walked through the hall
and let himself out the front door.
"Of all the nerve!" Helen burst out.
"Perhaps we shouldn't be too hard on the man," Miss Flora said timidly. "His
story is a pathetic one and I can see how he might want to pretend he had an
old American family background."
"I'd like to bet a cookie Mr. Comber didn't mean one word of what he was
saying," Helen remarked.
"Oh dear, I'm so confused," said Miss Flora, her voice trembling. "Let's all
sit down in the parlor and talk about it a little more."

The two girls stepped back as Miss Flora, then Aunt Rosemary, left the dining
room. They followed to the parlor and sat down together on the recessed couch
by the fireplace. Nancy, on a sudden hunch, ran to a front window to see which
direction Comber had taken. To her surprise he was walking down the winding
driveway.
"That's strange. Evidently he didn't drive," Nancy told herself. "It's quite a
walk into town to get a train or bus to River Heights."
As Nancy mulled over this idea, trying to figure out the answer, she became
conscious of creaking sounds. Helen suddenly gave a shriek. Nancy turned
quickly.
"Look!" Helen cried, pointing toward the ceiling, and everyone stared upward.
The crystal chandelier had suddenly started swaying from side to side!
"The ghost again!" Miss Flora cried out. She looked as if she were about to
faint.
Nancy's eyes quickly swept the room. Nothing else in it was moving, so
vibration was not causing the chandelier to sway. As it swung back and forth,
a sudden thought came to the young sleuth. Maybe someone in Miss Flora's room
above was causing the shaking.
"I'm going upstairs to investigate," Nancy told the others.
Racing noiselessly on tiptoe out of the room and through the hall, she began
climbing the stairs, hugging the wall so the steps would not creak. As she
neared the top, Nancy was sure she heard a door close. Hurrying along the
hall, she burst into Miss Flora's bedroom. No one was in sight!
"Maybe this time the ghost couldn't get away and is in that wardrobe!" Nancy
thought.
Helen and her relatives had come up the stairs behind Nancy. They reached the
bedroom just as she flung open the wardrobe doors. But for the second time she
found no one hiding there.
Nancy bit her lip in vexation. The ghost was clever indeed. Where had he gone?
She had given him no time to go down the hall or run into another room. Yet
there was no denying the fact that he had been in Miss Flora's room!
"Tell us why you came up," Helen begged her. Nancy told her theory, but
suddenly she realized that maybe she was letting her imagination run. wild. It
was possible, she admitted to the others, that no one had caused the
chandelier to shake.
"There's only one way to find out," she said. "I'll make a test."
Nancy asked Helen to go back to the first floor and watch the chandelier. She
would try to make it sway by rocking from side to side on the floor above it.
"If this works, then I'm sure we've picked up a clue to the ghost," she said
hopefully.
Helen readily agreed and left the room. When Nancy thought her friend had had
time to reach the parlor below, she began to rock hard from side to side on
the spot above the chandelier.
She had barely started the test when from the first floor Helen Corning gave a
piercing scream!
The Gorilla Face
"SOMETHING has happened to Helen!" Aunt Rosemary cried out fearfully.
Nancy was already racing through the second-floor hallway. Reaching the
stairs, she leaped down them two steps at a time. Helen Corning had collapsed
in a wing chair in the parlor, her hands over her face.
"Helen! What happened?" Nancy asked, reaching her friend's side.
"Out there! Looking in that window!" Helen pointed to the front window of the
parlor next to the hall. "The most horrible face I ever saw!"
"Was it a man's face?" Nancy questioned.
"Oh, I don't know. It looked just like a gorilla!" Helen closed her eyes as if
to shut out the memory of the sight.
Nancy did not wait to hear any more. In another second she was at the front
door and had yanked it open. Stepping outside, she looked all around. She
could see no animal near the house, nor any sign under the window that one had

stood there.
Puzzled, the young sleuth hurried down the steps and began a search of the
grounds. By this time Helen had collected her wits and come outside. She
joined Nancy and together they looked in every outbuilding and behind every
clump of bushes on the grounds of Twin Elms. They did not find one footprint
or any other evidence to prove that a gorilla or other creature had been on
the grounds of the estate.
"I saw it! I know I saw it!" Helen insisted.
"I don't doubt you," Nancy replied.
"Then what explanation is there?" Helen demanded. "You know I never did
believe in spooks. But if we have many more of these weird happenings around
here, I declare I'm going to start believing in ghosts."
Nancy laughed. "Don't worry, Helen," she said. "There'll be a logical
explanation for the face at the window."
The girls walked back to the front door of the mansion. Miss Flora and Aunt
Rosemary stood there and immediately insisted upon knowing what had happened.
As Helen told them, Nancy once more surveyed the outside of the window at
which Helen had seen the terrifying face.
"I have a theory," she spoke up. "Our ghost simply leaned across from the end
of the porch and held a mask in front of the window." Nancy stretched her arm
out to demonstrate how this was possible.
"So that's why he didn't leave any footprints under the window," Helen said.
"But he certainly got away from here fast." She suddenly laughed. "He must be
on some ghosts' track team."
Her humor, Nancy was glad to see, relieved the tense situation. She had
noticed Miss Flora leaning wearily on her daughter's arm.
"You'd better lie down and rest, Mother," Mrs. Hayes advised.
"I guess I will," Aunt Flora agreed.
It was suggested that the elderly woman use Aunt Rosemary's room, while the
others continued the experiment with the chandelier.
Helen and Aunt Rosemary went into the parlor and waited as Nancy ascended the
front stairway and went to Miss Flora's bedroom. Once more she began to rock
from side to side. Downstairs, Aunt Rosemary and her niece were gazing
intently at the ceiling.
"Look!" Helen exclaimed, pointing to the crystal chandelier. "It's moving!" In
a moment it swung to the left, then back to the right.
"Nancy has proved that the ghost was up in my mother's room!" Aunt Rosemary
said excitedly.
After a few minutes the rocking motion of the chandelier slackened and finally
stopped. Nancy came hurrying down the steps.
"Did it work?" she called.
"Yes, it did," Aunt Rosemary replied. "Oh, Nancy, we must have two ghosts!"
"Why do you say that?" Helen asked.
"One rocking the chandelier, the other holding the horrible face up to the
window. No one could have gone from Miss Flora's room to the front porch in
such a short time. Oh, this complicates everything!"
"It certainly does," Nancy agreed. "The question is, are the two ghosts in
cahoots? Or, it's just possible, there is only one. He could have disappeared
from Miss Flora's room without our seeing him and somehow hurried to the first
floor and let himself out the front door while we were upstairs. I'm convinced
there is at least one secret entrance into this house, and maybe more. I think
our next step should be to try to find it—or them."
"We'd better wash the luncheon dishes first," Aunt Rosemary suggested.
As she and the girls worked, they discussed the mystery, and Mrs. Hayes
revealed that she had talked to her mother about leaving the house, whether or
not she sold it.
"I thought we might at least go away for a little vacation, but Mother refuses
to leave. She says she intends to remain right here until this ghost business
is settled."
Helen smiled.  "Nancy, my great-grandmother is a wonderful woman. She has

taught me a lot about courage and perseverance. I hope if I ever reach her
age, I'll have half as much."
"Yes, she's an example to all of us," Aunt Rosemary concurred.
Nancy nodded. "I agree. I haven't known your mother long, Aunt Rosemary, but I
think she is one of the dearest persons I've ever met."
"If Miss Flora won't leave," said Helen, "I guess that means we all stay."
"That's settled," said Nancy with a smile.
After the dishes were put away, the girls were ready to begin their search for
a secret entrance into the mansion.
"Let's start with Miss Flora's room," Helen suggested.
"That's a logical place," Nancy replied, and took the lead up the stairway.
Every inch of the wall, which was paneled in maple halfway to the ceiling, was
tapped. No hollow sound came from any section of it to indicate an open space
behind. The bureau, dressing table, and bed were pulled away from the walls
and Nancy carefully inspected every inch of the paneling for cracks or wide
seams to indicate a concealed door.
"Nothing yet," she announced, and then decided to inspect the sides of the
fireplace.
The paneled sides and brick front revealed nothing. Next, Nancy looked at the
sides and rear of
the stone interior. She could see nothing unusual, and the blackened stones
did not look as if they had ever been disturbed.
She closed the damper which Helen had left open, and then suggested that the
searchers transfer to another room on the second floor. But no trace of any
secret entrance to the mansion could be found.
"I think we've had enough investigation for one day," Aunt Rosemary remarked.
Nancy was about to say that she was not tired and would like to continue. But
she realized that Mrs. Hayes had made this suggestion because her mother was
once more showing signs of fatigue and strain.
Helen, who also realized the situation, said, "Let's have an early supper. I'm
starved I"
"I am, too," Nancy replied, laughing gaily.
The mood was contagious and soon Miss Flora seemed to have forgotten about her
mansion being haunted. She sat in the kitchen while Aunt Rosemary and the
girls cooked the meal.
"Um, steak and French fried potatoes, fresh peas, and yummy floating island
for dessert," said Helen. "I can hardly wait."
"Fruit cup first," Aunt Rosemary announced, taking a bowl of fruit from the
refrigerator.
Soon the group was seated at the table. Tactfully steering the conversation
away from the mystery, Nancy asked Miss Flora to tell the group about parties
and dances which had been held in the mansion long ago.
The elderly woman smiled in recollection. "I remember one story my husband
told me of something that happened when he was a little boy," Miss Flora
began. "His parents were holding a masquerade and he was supposed to be in bed
fast asleep. His nurse had gone downstairs to talk to some of the servants.
The music awakened my husband and he decided it would be great fun to join the
guests.
"I’ll put on a costume myself,' he said to himself. He knew there were some
packed in a trunk in the attic." Miss Flora paused. "By the way, girls, I
think that sometime while you are here you ought to see them. They're
beautiful.
"Well, Everett went to the attic, opened the trunk, and searched until he
found a soldier's outfit. It was very fancy—red coat and white trousers. He
had quite a struggle getting it on and had to turn the coat sleeves way up.
The knee britches came to his ankles, and the hat was so large it came down
over his ears."
By this time Miss Flora's audience was laughing and Aunt Rosemary remarked,
"My father really must have looked funny. Please go on, Mother."
"Little Everett came down the stairs and mingled with the masqueraders at the

dance. For a while he wasn't noticed, then suddenly his mother discovered the
queer-looking figure."
"And," Aunt Rosemary interrupted, "quickly put him back to bed, I'm sure."
Miss Flora laughed. "That's where you're wrong. The guests thought the whole
thing was such fun that they insisted Everett stay. Some of the women danced
with him—he went to dancing school and was an excellent dancer. Then they gave
him some strawberries and cream and cake."
Helen remarked, "And then put him to bed."
Again Miss Flora laughed. "The poor little fellow never knew that he had
fallen asleep while he was eating, and his father had to carry him upstairs.
He was put into his little four-poster, costume and all. Of course his nurse
was horrified, and I'm afraid that during the rest of the night the poor woman
thought she would lose her position. But she didn't. In fact, she stayed with
the family until all the children were grown up."
"Oh, that's a wonderful story!" said Nancy.
She was about to urge Miss Flora to tell another story when the telephone
rang. Aunt Rosemary answered it, and then called to Nancy, "It's for you."
Nancy hurried to the hall, grabbed up the phone, and said, "Hello." A moment
later she cried out, "Dad! How wonderful to hear from you!"
Mr. Drew said that he had not found Willie Wharton and certain clues seemed to
indicate that he was not in Chicago, but in some other city.
"I have a few other matters to take care of that will keep me here until
tomorrow night. How are you getting along?"
"I haven't solved the mystery yet," his daughter reported. "We've had some
more strange happenings. I'll certainly be glad to see you here at Cliffwood.
I know you can help me."
"All right, I'll come. But don't try to meet me. The time is too uncertain,
and as a matter of fact, I may find that I'll have to stay here in Chicago."
Mr. Drew said he would come out to the mansion by taxi. Briefly Nancy related
her experiences at Twin Elms, and after a little more conversation, hung up.
When she rejoined the others at the table, she told them about Mr. Drew's
promised visit.
"Oh, I'll be so happy to meet your father," said Miss Flora. "We may need
legal advice in this mystery."
There was a pause after this remark, with everyone silent for a few moments.
Suddenly each one in the group looked at the others, startled. From somewhere
upstairs came the plaintive strains of violin music. Had the radio been turned
on again by the ghost?
Nancy dashed from the table to find out.
Frightening Eyes
WITHIN five seconds Nancy had reached the second floor. The violin playing
suddenly ceased.
She raced into Miss Flora's room, from which the sounds had seemed to come.
The radio was not on. Quickly Nancy felt the instrument to see if it were even
slightly warm to prove it had been in use.
"The music wasn't being played on this," she told herself, finding the radio
cool.
As Nancy dashed from the room, she almost ran into Helen. "What did you find
out?" her friend asked breathlessly.
"Nothing so far," Nancy replied, as she raced into Aunt Rosemary's bedroom to
check the bedside radio in there.
This instrument, too, felt cool to the touch.
She and Helen stood in the center of the room, puzzled frowns creasing their
foreheads. "There was music, wasn't there?" Helen questioned.
"I distinctly heard it," Nancy replied. "But where is the person who played
the violin? Or put a disk on a record player, or turned on a hidden radio?
Helen, I'm positive an intruder comes into this mansion by some secret
entrance and tries to frighten us all."
"And succeeds," Helen answered. "It's positively eerie."

"And dangerous," Nancy thought.
"Let's continue our search right after breakfast tomorrow," Helen proposed.
"We will," Nancy responded. "But in the meantime I believe Miss Flora and Aunt
Rosemary, to say nothing of ourselves, need some police protection."
"I think you're right," Helen agreed. "Let's go downstairs and suggest it to
the others."
The girls returned to the first floor and Nancy told Mrs. Hayes and her mother
of the failure to find the cause of the violin playing, and what she had in
mind.
"Oh dear, the police will only laugh at us," Miss Flora objected.
"Mother dear," said her daughter, "the captain and his men didn't believe us
before because they thought we were imagining things. But Nancy and Helen
heard music at two different times and they saw the chandelier rock. I'm sure
that Captain Rossland will believe Nancy and send a guard out here."
Nancy smiled at Miss Flora. "I shan't ask the captain to believe in a ghost or
even hunt for one. I think all we should request at the moment is that he have
a man patrol the grounds here at night. I'm sure that we're perfectly safe
while we're all awake, but I must admit I'd feel a little uneasy about going
to bed wondering what that ghost may do next."
Mrs. Turnbull finally agreed to the plan and Nancy went to the telephone.
Captain Rossland readily agreed to send a man out a little later.
"He'll return each night as long as you need him," the officer stated. "And
I'll tell him not to ring the bell to tell you when he comes. If there is
anyone who breaks into the mansion by a secret entrance, it would be much
better if he does not know a guard is on duty."
"I understand," said Nancy.
When Miss Flora, her daughter, and the two girls went to bed, they were
confident they would have a restful night. Nancy felt that if there was no
disturbance, then it would indicate that the ghost's means of entry into Twin
Elms was directly from the outside. "In which case," she thought, "it will
mean he saw the guard and didn't dare come inside the house."
The young sleuth's desire for a good night's sleep was rudely thwarted as she
awakened about midnight with a start. Nancy was sure she had heard a noise
nearby. But now the house was quiet. Nancy listened intently, then finally got
out of bed.
"Perhaps the noise I heard came from outdoors," she told herself.
Tiptoeing to a window, so that she would not awaken Helen, Nancy peered out at
the moonlit grounds. Shadows made by tree branches, which swayed in a gentle
breeze, moved back and forth across the lawn. The scent from a rose garden in
full bloom was wafted to Nancy.
"What a heavenly night!" she thought.
Suddenly Nancy gave a start. A furtive figure had darted from behind a tree
toward a clump of bushes. Was he the guard or the ghost? she wondered. As
Nancy watched intently to see if she could detect any further movements of the
mysterious figure, she heard padding footsteps in the hall. In a moment there
was a loud knock on her door.
"Nancy! Wake up! Nancy! Come quick!"
The voice was Miss Flora's, and she sounded extremely frightened. Nancy sped
across the room, unlocked her door, and opened it wide. By this time Helen was
awake and out of bed.
"What happened?" she asked sleepily.
Aunt Rosemary had come into the hall also. Her mother did not say a word; just
started back toward her own bedroom. The others followed, wondering what they
would find. Moonlight brightened part of the room, but the area near the hall
was dark.
"There! Up there!" Miss Flora pointed to a corner of the room near the hall.
Two burning eyes looked down on the watchers!
Instantly Nancy snapped on the wall light and the group gazed upward at a
large brown owl perched on the old-fashioned, ornamental picture molding.
"Oh!" Aunt Rosemary cried out. "How did that bird ever get in here?"

The others did not answer at once. Then Nancy, not wishing to frighten Miss
Flora, remarked as casually as she could, "It probably came down the chimney."
"But—" Helen started to say.
Nancy gave her friend a warning wink and Helen did not finish the sentence.
Nancy was sure she was going to say that the damper had been closed and the
bird could not possibly have flown into the room from the chimney. Turning to
Miss Flora, Nancy asked whether or not her bedroom door had been locked.
"Oh, yes," the elderly woman insisted. "I wouldn't leave it unlocked for
anything."
Nancy did not comment. Knowing that Miss Flora was a bit forgetful, she
thought it quite possible that the door had not been locked. An intruder had
entered, let the owl fly to the picture molding, then made just enough noise
to awaken the sleeping woman.
To satisfy her own memory about the damper, Nancy went over to the fireplace
and looked inside. The damper was closed.
"But if the door to the hall was locked," she reasoned, "then the ghost has
some other way of getting into this room. And he escaped the detection of the
guard."
"I don't want that owl in here all night," Miss Flora broke into Nancy's
reverie. "We'll have to get it out."
"That's not going to be easy," Aunt Rosemary spoke up. "Owls have very sharp
claws and beaks and they use them viciously on anybody who tries to disturb
them. Mother, you come and sleep in my room the rest of the night. We'll chase
the owl out in the morning."
Nancy urged Miss Flora to go with her daughter. "I'll stay here and try
getting Mr. Owl out of the house. Have you a pair of old heavy gloves?"
"I have some in my room," Aunt Rosemary replied. "They're thick leather. I use
them for gardening."
She brought them to Nancy, who put the gloves on at once. Then she suggested
that Aunt Rosemary and her mother leave. Nancy smiled. "Helen and I will take
over Operation Owl."
As the door closed behind the two women. Nancy dragged a chair to the corner
of the room beneath the bird. She was counting on the fact that the bright
overhead light had dulled the owl's vision and she would be able to grab it
without too much trouble.
"Helen, will you open one of the screens, please?" she requested. "And wish me
luck!"
"Don't let that thing get loose," Helen warned as she unfastened the screen
and held it far out.
Nancy reached up and by stretching was just able to grasp the bird. In a
lightning movement she had put her two hands around its body and imprisoned
its claws. At once the owl began to bob its head and peck at her arms above
the gloves. Wincing with pain, she stepped down from the chair and ran across
the room.
The bird squirmed, darting its beak in first one direction, then another. But
Nancy managed to hold the owl in such a position that most of the pecking
missed its goal. She held the bird out the window, released it, and stepped
back. Helen closed the screen and quickly fastened it.
"Oh!" Nancy said, gazing ruefully at her wrists which now showed several
bloody digs from the owl's beak. "I'm glad that's over."
"And I am too," said Helen. "Let's lock Miss Flora's door from the outside, so
that ghost can't bring in any owls to the rest of us."
Suddenly Helen grabbed Nancy's arm. "I just thought of something," she said.
"There's supposed to be a police guard outside. Yet the ghost got in here
without being seen."
"Either that, or there's a secret entrance to this mansion which runs
underground, probably to one of the outbuildings on the property."
Nancy now told about the furtive figure she had seen dart from behind a tree.
"I must find out right away if he was the ghost or the guard. I'll do a little
snooping around. It's possible the guard didn't show up." Nancy smiled. "But

if he did, and he's any good, he'll find me!"
"All right," said Helen.. "But, Nancy, do be careful. You're really taking
awful chances to solve the mystery of Twin Elms."
Nancy laughed softly as she walked back to the girls' bedroom. She dressed
quickly, then went downstairs, put the back-door key in her pocket, and let
herself out of the house. Stealthily she went down the steps and glided to a
spot back of some bushes.
Seeing no one around, she came from behind them and ran across the lawn to a
large maple tree. She stood among the shadows for several moments, then darted
out toward a building which in Colonial times had been used as the kitchen.
Halfway there, she heard a sound behind her and turned. A man stood in the
shadows not ten feet away. Quick as a wink one hand flew to a holster on his
hip.
"Halt!" he commanded.
A Startling Plunge
NANCY halted as directed and stood facing the man. "Who are you?" she asked.
"I'm a police guard, miss," the man replied. "Just call me Patrick, And who
are you?"
Quickly Nancy explained and then asked to see his identification. He opened
his coat, pulled out a leather case, and showed her his shield proving that he
was a plain-clothes man. His name was Tom Patrick.
"Have you seen anyone prowling around the grounds?" Nancy asked him.
"Not a soul, miss. This place has been quieter than a cemetery tonight."
When the young sleuth told him about the furtive figure she had seen from the
window, the detective laughed. "I believe you saw me," he said. "I guess I'm
not so good at hiding as I thought I was."
Nancy laughed lightly. "Anyway, you soon nabbed me," she told him.
The two chatted for several minutes. Tom Patrick told Nancy that people in
Cliffwood regarded Mrs. Turnbull as being a little queer. They said that if
she thought her house was haunted, it was all in line with the stories of the
odd people who had lived there from tune to time during the past hundred years
or so.
"Would this rumor make the property difficult to sell?" Nancy questioned the
detective.
"It certainly would."
Nancy said she thought the whole thing was a shame. "Mrs. Turnbull is one of
the loveliest women I've ever met and there's not a thing the matter with her,
except that once in a while she is forgetful."
"You don't think that some of these happenings we've heard about are just pure
imagination?" Tom Patrick asked.
"No, I don't."
Nancy now told him about the owl in Miss Flora's bedroom. "The door was
locked, every screen was fastened, and the damper in the chimney closed. You
tell me how the owl got in there."
Tom Patrick's eyes opened wide. "You say this happened only a little while
ago?" he queried. When Nancy nodded, he added, "Of course I can't be
everywhere on these grounds at once, but I've been round and round the
building. I've never stopped walking since I arrived. I don't see how anyone
could have gotten inside that mansion without my seeing him."
"I'll tell you my theory," said Nancy. "I believe there's a secret underground
entrance from some other place on the grounds. It may be in one of these
outbuildings. Anyway, tomorrow morning I'm going on a search for it."
"Well, I wish you luck," Tom Patrick said. "And if anything happens during the
night, I'll let you know."
Nancy pointed to a window on the second floor. "That's my room," she said. "If
you don't have a chance to use the door knocker, just throw a stone up against
the screen to alert me. I'll wake up instantly, I know."
The guard promised to do this and Nancy went back into the mansion. She
climbed the stairs and for a second time that night undressed. Helen had

already gone back to sleep, so Nancy crawled into the big double bed
noiselessly.
The two girls awoke the next morning about the same time and immediately Helen
asked for full details of what Nancy had learned outdoors the night before.
After hearing how her friend had been stopped by the guard, she shivered.
"You might have been in real danger, Nancy, not knowing who he was. You must
be more careful. Suppose that man had been the ghost?"
Nancy laughed but made no reply.   The girls went downstairs and started to
prepare breakfast. In a few minutes Aunt Rosemary and her mother joined them.
"Did you find out anything more last night?" Mrs. Hayes asked Nancy.
"Only that a police guard named Tom Patrick is on duty," Nancy answered.
As soon as breakfast was over, the young sleuth announced that she was about
to investigate all the outbuildings on the estate.
"I'm going to search for an underground passage leading to the mansion. It's
just possible that we hear no hollow sounds when we tap the walls, because of
double doors or walls where the entrance is."
Aunt Rosemary looked at Nancy intently. "You are a real detective, Nancy. I
see now why Helen wanted us to ask you to find our ghost."
Nancy's eyes twinkled. "I may have some instinct for sleuthing," she said,
"but unless I can solve this mystery, it won't do any of us much good."
Turning to Helen, she suggested that they put on the old clothes they had
brought with them.
Attired in sport shirts and jeans, the girls left the house. Nancy led the way
first to the old icehouse. She rolled back the creaking, sliding door and
gazed within. The tall, narrow building was about ten feet square. On one side
were a series of sliding doors, one above the other.
"I've heard Miss Flora say," Helen spoke up, "that in days gone by huge blocks
of ice were cut from the river when it was frozen over and dragged here on a
sledge. The blocks were stored here and taken off from the top down through
these various sliding doors."
"That story rather rules out the possibility of any underground passage
leading from this building," said Nancy. "I presume there was ice in here most
of the year."
The floor was covered with dank sawdust, and although Nancy was sure she would
find nothing of interest beneath it, still she decided to take a look. Seeing
an old, rusted shovel in one corner, she picked it up and began to dig. There
was only dirt beneath the sawdust.
"Well, that clue fizzled out," Helen remarked, as she and Nancy started for
the next building.
This had once been used as a smokehouse. It, too, had an earthen floor. In one
corner was a small fireplace, where smoldering fires of hickory wood had once
burned. The smoke had curled up a narrow chimney to the second floor, which
was windowless.
"Rows and rows of huge chunks of pork hung up there on hooks to be smoked,"
Helen explained, "and days later turned into luscious hams and bacon."
There was no indication of a secret opening and Nancy went outside the small,
two-story, peak-roofed structure and walked around. Up one side of the brick
building and leading to a door above were the remnants of a ladder. Now only
the sidepieces which had held the rungs remained.
"Give me a boost, will you, Helen?" Nancy requested. "I want to take a look
inside."
Helen squatted on the ground and Nancy climbed to her shoulders. Then Helen,
bracing her hands against the wall,, straightened up. Nancy opened the
half-rotted wooden door.
"No ghost here!" she announced.
Nancy jumped to the ground and started for the servants' quarters. But a
thorough inspection of this brick-and-wood structure failed to reveal a clue
to a secret passageway.
There was only one outbuilding left to investigate, which Helen said was the
old carriage house. This was built of brick and was fairly large. No carriages

stood on its wooden floor, but around the walls hung old harnesses and reins.
Nancy paused a moment to examine one of the bridles. It was set with two
hand-painted medallions of women's portraits.
Suddenly her reflection was interrupted by a scream. Turning, she was just in
time to see Helen plunge through a hole in the floor. In a flash Nancy was
across the carriage house and looking down into a gaping hole where the rotted
floor had given way.
"Helen!" she cried out in alarm.
"I'm all right," came a voice from below. "Nice and soft down here. Please
throw me your flash."
Nancy removed the flashlight from the pocket of her jeans and tossed it down.
"I thought maybe I'd discovered something," Helen said. "But this is just a
plain old hole. Give me a hand, will you, so I can climb up?"
Nancy lay flat on the floor and with one arm grabbed a supporting beam that
stood in the center of the carriage house. Reaching down with the other arm,
she assisted Helen in her ascent.
"We'd better watch our step around here," Nancy said as her friend once more
stood beside her.
"You're so right," Helen agreed, brushing dirt off her jeans. Helen's plunge
had given Nancy an idea that there might be other openings in the floor and
that one of them could be an entrance to a subterranean passage. But though
she flashed her light over every inch of the carriage-house floor, she could
discover nothing suspicious.
"Let's quit!" Helen suggested. "I'm a mess, and besides, I'm hungry."
"All right," Nancy agreed. "Are you game to search the cellar this afternoon?"
"Oh, sure."
After lunch they started to investigate the storerooms in the cellar. There
was a cool stone room where barrels of apples had once been kept. There was
another, formerly filled with bags of whole-wheat flour, barley, buckwheat,
and oatmeal.
"And everything was grown on the estate," said Helen.
"Oh, it must have been perfectly wonderful," Nancy said. "I wish we could go
back in time and see how life was in those days!"
"Maybe if we could, we'd know how to find that ghost," Helen remarked. Nancy
thought so too.
As the girls went from room to room in the cellar, Nancy beamed her flashlight
over every inch of wall and floor. At times, the young sleuth's pulse would
quicken when she thought she had discovered a trap door or secret opening. But
each time she had to admit failure—there was no evidence of either one in the
cellar.
"This has been a discouraging day," Nancy remarked, sighing. "But I'm not
giving up."
Helen felt sorry for her friend. To cheer Nancy, she said with a laugh,
"Storeroom after storeroom but no room to store a ghost!"
Nancy had to laugh, and together the two girls ascended the stairway to the
kitchen. After changing their clothes, they helped Aunt Rosemary prepare the
evening dinner. When the group had eaten and later gathered in the parlor,
Nancy reminded the others that she expected her father to arrive the next day.
"Dad didn't want me to bother meeting him, but I just can't wait to see him. I
think I'll meet all the trains from Chicago that stop here."
"I hope your father will stay with us for two or three days," Miss Flora spoke
up. "Surely he'll have some ideas about our ghost."
"And good ones, too," Nancy said. "If he's on the early train, he'll have
breakfast with us. I'll meet it at eight o'clock."
But later that evening Nancy's plans were suddenly changed. Hannah Gruen
telephoned her to say that a man at the telegraph office had called the house
a short time before to read a message from Mr. Drew. He had been unavoidably
detained and would not arrive Wednesday.
"In the telegram your father said that he will let us know when he will
arrive," the housekeeper added.

"I'm disappointed," Nancy remarked, "but I hope this delay means that Dad is
on the trail of Willie Wharton!"
"Speaking of Willie Wharton," said Hannah, "I heard something about him
today."
"What was that?" Nancy asked.
"That he was seen down by the river right here in River Heights a couple of
days ago!"
A Worrisome Delay
"You say Willie Wharton was seen in River Heights down by the river?" Nancy
asked unbelievingly.
"Yes," Hannah replied. "I learned it from our postman, Mr. Ritter, who is one
of the people that sold property to the railroad. As you know, Nancy, Mr.
Ritter is very honest and reliable. Well, he said he'd heard that some of the
property owners were trying to horn in on this deal of Willie Wharton's for
getting more money. But Mr. Ritter wouldn't have a thing to do with it—calls
it a holdup."
"Did Mr. Ritter himself see Willie Wharton?" Nancy asked eagerly.
"No," the housekeeper replied. "One of the other property, owners told him
Willie was around."
"That man could be mistaken," Nancy suggested.
"Of course he might," Hannah agreed. "And I'm inclined to think he is. If your
father is staying over in Chicago, it must be because of Willie Wharton."
Nancy did not tell Hannah what was racing through her mind. She said good
night cheerfully, but actually she was very much worried.
"Maybe Willie Wharton was seen down by the river," she mused. "And maybe Dad
was 'unavoidably detained' by an enemy of his in connection with the railroad
bridge project. One of the dissatisfied property owners might have followed
him to Chicago."
Or, she reflected further, it was not inconceivable that Mr. Drew had found
Willie Wharton, only to have Willie hold the lawyer a prisoner.
As Nancy sat lost in anxious thought, Helen came into the hall. "Something the
matter?" she asked.
"I don't know," Nancy replied, "but I have a feeling there is. Dad telegraphed
to say that he wouldn't be here tomorrow. Instead of wiring, he always phones
me or Hannah or his office when he is away and it seems strange that he didn't
do so this time."
"You told me a few days ago that your father had been threatened," said Helen.
"Are you afraid it has something to do with that?"
"Yes, I am."
"Is there anything I can do?" Helen offered.
"Thank you, Helen, but I think not. There isn't anything I can do either.
We'll just have to wait and see what happens. Maybe I'll hear from Dad again."
Nancy looked so downcast that Helen searched her mind to find something which
would cheer her friend. Suddenly Helen had an idea and went to speak to Miss
Flora and Aunt Rosemary about it.
"I think it's a wonderful plan if Nancy will do it," Aunt Rosemary said.
Helen called Nancy from the hall and proposed that they all go to the attic to
look in the big trunk containing the old costumes.
"We might even put them on," Miss Flora proposed, smiling girlishly.
"And you girls could dance the minuet," said Aunt Rosemary enthusiastically.
"Mother plays the old spinet very well. Maybe she would play a minuet for
you."
"I love your idea," said Nancy. She knew that the three were trying to boost
her spirits and she appreciated it. Besides, what they had proposed sounded
like fun.
All of them trooped up the creaky attic stairs. In their haste, none of the
group had remembered to bring flashlights.
"I'll go downstairs and get a couple," Nancy offered.
"Never mind," Aunt Rosemary spoke up.

"There are some candles and holders right here. We keep them for emergencies."
She lighted two white candles which stood in old-fashioned, saucer-type brass
holders and led the way to the costume trunk.
As Helen lifted the heavy lid, Nancy exclaimed in delight, "How beautiful the
clothes are!"
She could see silks, satins, and laces at one side. At the other was a
folded-up rose velvet robe. She and Helen lifted out the garments and held
them up.
"They're really lovelier than our formal dance clothes today," Helen remarked.
"Especially the men's!"
Miss Flora smiled.  "And a lot more flattering!"
The entire trunk was unpacked, before the group selected what they would wear.
"This pale-green silk gown with the panniers would look lovely on you, Nancy,"
Miss Flora said. "And I'm sure it's just the right size, too."
Nancy surveyed the tiny waist of the ball gown. "I'll try it on," she said.
Then laughingly she added, "But I'll probably have to hold my breath to close
it in the middle. My, but the women in olden times certainly had slim
waistlines!"
Helen was holding up a man's purple velvet suit. It had knee breeches and the
waistcoat had a lace-ruffled front. There were a tricorn hat, long white
stockings, and buckled slippers to complete the costume.
"I think I'll wear this and be your partner, Nancy," Helen said.
Taking off her pumps, she slid her feet into the buckled slippers. The others
laughed aloud. A man with a foot twice the size of Helen's had once worn the
slippers!
"Never mind. I'll stuff the empty space with paper," Helen announced gaily.
Miss Flora and Aunt Rosemary selected gowns for themselves, then opened a
good-sized box at the bottom of the trunk. It contained various kinds of wigs
worn in Colonial times. All were pure white and fluffy.
Carrying the costumes and wigs, the group descended to their bedrooms, where
they changed into the fancy clothes, then went to the first floor. Miss Flora
led the way into the room across the hall from the parlor. She said it once
had been the drawing room. Later it had become a library, but the old spinet
still stood in a corner.
Miss Flora sat down at the instrument and began to play Beethoven's "Minuet."
Aunt Rosemary sat down beside her.
Nancy and Helen, dubbed by the latter, Master and Mistress Colonial America,
began to dance. They clasped their right hands high in the air, then took two
steps backward and made little bows. They circled, then strutted, and even put
in a few steps with which no dancers in Colonial times would have been
familiar.
Aunt Rosemary giggled and clapped. "I wish President Washington would come to
see you," she said, acting out her part in the entertainment. "Mistress Nancy,
prithee do an encore and Master Corning, wilt thou accompany thy fair lady?"
The girls could barely keep from giggling. Helen made a low bow to her aunt,
her tricorn in her hand, and said, "At your service, my lady. Your every wish
is my command!"
The minuet was repeated, then as Miss Flora stopped playing, the girls sat
down.
"Oh, that was such fun!" said Nancy. "Some time I'd like to— Listen!" she
commanded suddenly.
From outside the house they could hear loud shouting. "Come here! You in the
house! Come here!"
Nancy and Helen dashed from their chairs to the front door. Nancy snapped on
the porch light and the two girls raced outside.
"Over here!" a man's voice urged.
Nancy and Helen ran down the steps and out onto the lawn. Just ahead of them
stood Tom Patrick, the police detective. In a viselike grip he was holding a
thin, bent-over man whom the girls judged to be about fifty years of age.
"Is this your ghost?" the guard asked.

His prisoner was struggling to free himself but was unable to get loose. The
girls hurried forward to look at the man.
"I caught him sneaking along the edge of the grounds," Tom Patrick announced.
"Let me go!" the man cried out angrily. "I'm no ghost. What are you talking
about?"
"You may not be a ghost," the detective said, "but you could be the thief who
has been robbing this house."
"What?" his prisoner exclaimed. "I'm no thief I live around here. Anyone will
tell you I'm okay."
"What's your name and where do you live?" the detective prodded. He let the
man stand up straight but held one of his arms firmly.
"My name's Albert Watson and I live over on Tuttle Road."
"What were you doing on this property?"
Albert Watson said he had been taking a short cut home. His wife had taken
their car for the evening.
"I'd been to a friend's house. You can call him and verify what I'm saying.
And you can call my wife, too. Maybe she's home now and she'll come and get
me."
The guard reminded Albert Watson that he had not revealed why he was sneaking
along the ground.
"Well," the prisoner said, "it was because of you. I heard downtown that there
was a detective patrolling this place and I didn't want to bump into you. I
was afraid of just what did happen."
The man relaxed a little. "I guess you're a pretty good guard at that."
Detective Patrick let go of Albert Watson's arm. "Your story sounds okay, but
we'll go in the house and do some telephoning to find out if you're telling
the truth."
"You'll find out all right. Why, I'm even a notary public! They don't give a
notary's license to dishonest folks!" the trespasser insisted, Then he stared
at Nancy and Helen, "What are you doing in those funny clothes?"
"We—are—we were having a little costume party," Helen responded. In the
excitement she and Nancy had forgotten what they were wearing!
The two girls started for the house, with the men following. When Mr. Watson
and the guard saw Miss Flora and Aunt Rosemary also in costume they gazed at
the women in amusement.
Nancy introduced Mr. Watson. Miss Flora said she knew of him, although she had
never met the man. Two phone calls by the guard confirmed Watson's story. In a
little while his wife arrived at Twin Elms to drive her husband home, and
Detective Patrick went back to his guard duty.
Aunt Rosemary then turned out all the lights on the first floor and she, Miss
Flora, and the girls went upstairs. Bedroom doors were locked, and everyone
hoped there would be no disturbance during the night
"It was a good day, Nancy," said Helen, yawning, as she climbed into bed.
"Yes, it was," said Nancy. "Of course, I'm a little disappointed that we
aren't farther along solving the mystery but maybe by this time tomorrow—" She
looked toward Helen who did not answer. She was already sound asleep.
Nancy herself was under the covers a few minutes later. She lay staring at the
ceiling, going over the various events of the past two days. As her mind
recalled the scene in the attic when they were pulling costumes from the old
trunk, she suddenly gave a start.
"That section of wall back of the trunk!" she told herself. "The paneling
looked different somehow from the rest of the attic wall. Maybe it's movable
and leads to a secret exit! Tomorrow I'll find out!"
The Midnight Watch
As SOON as the two girls awoke the next morning, Nancy told Helen her plan.
"I'm with you," said Helen. "Oh, I do wish we could solve the mystery of the
ghost! I'm afraid that it's beginning to affect Miss Flora's health and yet
she won't leave Twin Elms."
"Maybe we can get Aunt Rosemary to keep her in the garden most of the day,"

Nancy suggested. "It's perfectly beautiful outside. We might even serve lunch
under the trees."
"I'm sure they'd love that," said Helen. "As soon as we get downstairs, let's
propose it."
Both women liked the suggestion. Aunt Rosemary had guessed their strategy and
was appreciative of it.
"I'll wash and dry the dishes," Nancy offered when breakfast was over. "Miss
Flora, why don't you and Aunt Rosemary go outside right now and take advantage
of this lovely sunshine?"
The frail, elderly woman smiled. There were deep circles under her eyes,
indicating that she had had a sleepless night.
"And I'll run the vacuum cleaner around and dust this first floor in less than
half an hour," Helen said merrily.
Her relatives caught the spirit of her enthusiasm and Miss Flora remarked, "I
wish you girls lived here all the time. Despite our troubles, you have brought
a feeling of gaiety back into our lives."
Both girls smiled at the compliment. As soon as the two women had gone
outdoors, the girls set to work with a will. At the end of the allotted half
hour, the first floor of the mansion was spotless. Nancy and Helen next went
to the second floor, quickly made the beds, and tidied the bathrooms.
"And now for that ghost!" said Helen, brandishing her flashlight.
Nancy took her own from a bureau drawer.
"Let's see if we can figure out how to climb these attic stairs without making
them creak," Nancy suggested. "Knowing how may come in handy some time."
This presented a real challenge. Every inch of each step was tried before the
girls finally worked out a pattern to follow in ascending the stairway
noiselessly.
Helen laughed, "This will certainly be a memory test, Nancy. I'll rehearse our
directions. First step, put your foot to the left near the wall. Second step,
right center. Third step, against the right wall. I'll need three feet to do
that!"
Nancy laughed too. "For myself, I think I'll skip the second step. Let's see.
On the fourth and fifth it's all right to step in the center, but on the sixth
you hug the left wall, on the seventh, the right wall—"
Helen interrupted. "But if you step on the eighth any place, it will creak. So
you skip it."
"Nine, ten, and eleven are okay," Nancy recalled. "But from there to fifteen
at the top we're in trouble."
"Let's see if I remember," said Helen. "On twelve, you go left, then right,
then right again. How can you do that without a jump and losing your balance
and tumbling down?"
"How about skipping fourteen and then stretching as far as you can to reach
the top one at the left where it doesn't squeak," Nancy replied. "Let's go!"
She and Helen went back to the second floor and began what was meant to be a
silent ascent. But both of them made so many mistakes at first the creaking
was terrific. Finally, however, the girls had the silent spots memorized
perfectly and went up noiselessly.
Nancy clicked on her flashlight and swung it onto the nearest wood-paneled
wall. Helen stared at it, then remarked, "This isn't made of long panels from
ceiling to floor. It's built of small pieces."
"That's right," said Nancy. "But see if you don't agree with me that the spot
back of the costume trunk near the chimney looks a little different. The grain
doesn't match the other wood."
The girls crossed the attic and Nancy beamed her flashlight over the suspected
paneling.
"It does look different," Helen said. "This could be a door, I suppose. But
there's no knob or other hardware on it." She ran her finger over a section
just above the floor, following the cracks at the edge of a
four-by-two-and-a-half-foot space.
"If it's a secret door," said Nancy, "the knob is on the other side."

"How are we going to open it?" Helen questioned.
"We might try prying the door open," Nancy proposed. "But first I want to test
it."
She tapped the entire panel with her knuckles. A look of disappointment came
over her face. "There's certainly no hollow space behind it," she said.
"Let's make sure," said Helen. "Suppose I go downstairs and get a screw driver
and hammer? We'll see what happens when we drive the screw driver through this
crack."
"Good idea, Helen."
While she was gone, Nancy inspected the rest of the attic walls and floor. She
did not find another spot which seemed suspicious. By this time Helen had
returned with the tools. Inserting the screw driver into one of the cracks,
she began to pound on the handle of it with the hammer.
Nancy watched hopefully. The screw driver went through the crack very easily
but immediately met an obstruction on the other side. Helen pulled the screw
driver out. "Nancy, you try your luck."
The young sleuth picked a different spot, but the results were the same. There
was no open space behind that portion of the attic wall.
"My hunch wasn't so good," said Nancy.
Helen suggested that they give up and go downstairs. "Anyway, I think the
postman will be here soon." She smiled. "I'm expecting a letter from Jim.
Mother said she would forward all my mail."
Nancy did not want to give up the search yet. But she nodded in agreement and
waved her friend toward the stairs. Then the young detective sat down on the
floor and cupped her chin in her hands. As she stared ahead, Nancy noticed
that Helen, in her eagerness to meet the postman, had not bothered to go
quietly down the attic steps. It sounded as if Helen had picked the squeakiest
spot on each step!
Nancy heard Helen go out the front door and suddenly realized that she was in
the big mansion all alone. "That may bring the ghost on a visit," she thought.
"If he is around, he may think I went outside with Helen! And I may learn
where the secret opening is!"
Nancy sat perfectly still, listening intently. Suddenly she flung her head up.
Was it her imagination, or did she hear the creak of steps? She was not
mistaken. Nancy strained her ears, trying to determine from where the sounds
were coming.
"I'm sure they're not from the attic stairs or the main staircase. And not the
back stairway. Even if the ghost was in the kitchen and unlocked the door to
the second floor, he'd know that the one at the top of the stairs was locked
from the other side."
Nancy's heart suddenly gave a leap. She was positive that the creaking sounds
were coming from somewhere behind the attic wall!
"A secret staircase!" she thought excitedly. "Maybe the ghost is entering the
second floor!"
Nancy waited until the sounds stopped, then she got to her feet, tiptoed
noiselessly down the attic steps and looked around. She could hear nothing.
Was the ghost standing quietly in one of the bedrooms? Probably Miss Flora's?
Treading so lightly that she did not make a sound, Nancy peered into each room
as she reached it. But no one was in any of them.
"Maybe he's on the first floor!" Nancy thought.
She descended the main stairway, hugging the wall so she would not make a
sound. Reaching the first floor, Nancy peered into the parlor. No one was
there. She looked in the library, the dining room, and the kitchen. She saw no
one.
"Well, the ghost didn't come into the house after all," Nancy concluded. "He
may have intended to, but changed his mind."
She felt more certain than at any time, however, that there was a secret
entrance to Twin Elms Mansion from a hidden stairway. But how to find it?
Suddenly the young sleuth snapped her fingers. "I know what I'll do! I'll set
a trap for that ghost!"

She reflected that he had taken jewelry, but those thefts had stopped.
Apparently he was afraid to go to the second floor.
"I wonder if anything is missing from the first floor," she mused. "Maybe he
has taken silverware or helped himself to some food."
Going to the back door, Nancy opened it and called to Helen, who was now
seated in the garden with Miss Flora and Aunt Rosemary. "What say we start
lunch?" she called, not wishing to distress Miss Flora by bringing up the
subject of the mystery.
"Okay," said Helen. In a few moments she joined Nancy, who asked if her friend
had received a letter.
Helen's eyes sparkled. "I sure did. Oh, Nancy, I can hardly wait for Jim to
get home!"
Nancy smiled. "The way you describe him, I can hardly wait to see him myself."
Then she told Helen the real reason she had called her into the kitchen. She
described the footsteps on what she was sure was a hidden, creaking stairway,
then added, "If we discover that food or something else is missing we'll know
he's been here again."
Helen offered to inspect the flat silver. "I know approximately how many
pieces should be in the buffet drawer," she said.
"And I'll look over the food supplies," Nancy suggested. "I have a pretty good
idea what was in the refrigerator and on the pantry shelf."
It was not many minutes before each of the girls discovered articles missing.
Helen said that nearly a dozen teaspoons were gone and Nancy figured that
several cans of food, some eggs, and a quart of milk had been taken.
"It just seems impossible to catch that thief," Helen said with a sigh.
On a sudden hunch Nancy took down from the wall a memo pad and pencil which
hung there. Putting a finger to her lips to indicate that Helen was not to
comment, Nancy wrote on the sheet:
"I think the only way to catch the ghost is to trap him. I believe he has one
or more microphones hidden some place and that he hears all our plans."
Nancy looked up at Helen, who nodded silently. Nancy continued to write, "I
don't want to worry Miss Flora or Aunt Rosemary, so let's keep our plans a
secret. I suggest that we go to bed tonight as usual and carry on a
conversation about our plans for tomorrow. But actually we won't take off our
clothes. Then about midnight let's tiptoe downstairs to watch. I'll wait in
the kitchen. Do you want to stay in the living room?"
Again Helen nodded. Nancy, thinking that they had been quiet too long, and
that if there was an eavesdropper nearby he might become suspicious, said
aloud, "What would Miss Flora and Aunt Rosemary like for lunch, Helen?"
"Why, uh—" Helen found it hard to transfer to the new subject. "They—uh—both
love soup."
"Then I'll make cream of chicken soup," said Nancy. "Hand me a can of chicken
and rice, will you? And I'll get the milk."
As Helen was doing this, Nancy lighted a match, held her recently written note
over the sink, and set fire to the paper.
Helen smiled. "Nancy thinks of everything," she said to herself.
The girls chatted gaily as they prepared the food and finally carried four
trays out to the garden. They did not mention their midnight plan. The day in
the garden was proving to be most beneficial to Miss Flora, and the girls were
sure she would sleep well that night.
Nancy's plan was followed to the letter. Just as the grandfather clock in the
hall was striking midnight, Nancy arrived in the kitchen and sat down to await
developments. Helen was posted in a living-room chair near the hall doorway.
Moonlight streamed into both rooms but the girls had taken seats in the
shadows.
Helen was mentally rehearsing the further instructions which Nancy had written
to her during the afternoon. The young sleuth had suggested that if Helen
should see anyone, she was to run to the front door, open it, and yell
"Police!" At the same time she was to try to watch where the intruder
disappeared.

The minutes ticked by. There was not a sound in the house. Then suddenly Nancy
heard the front door open with a bang and Helen's voice yell loudly and
clearly:
"Police! Help! Police!"
An Elusive Ghost
BY THE time Nancy reached the front hall, Tom Patrick, the police guard, had
rushed into the house. "Here I am!" he called. "What's the matter?"
Helen led the way into the living room, and switched on the chandelier light.
"That sofa next to the fireplace!" she said in a trembling voice. "It moved! I
saw it move!"
"You mean somebody moved it?" the detective asked.
"I—I don't know," Helen replied. "I couldn't see anybody."
Nancy walked over to the old-fashioned sofa, set in the niche alongside the
fireplace. Certainly the piece was in place now. If the ghost had moved it, he
had returned the sofa to its original position.
"Let's pull it out and see what we can find," Nancy suggested.
She tugged at one end, while the guard pulled the other. It occurred to Nancy
that a person who moved it alone would have to be very strong.
"Do you think your ghost came up through a trap door or something?" the
detective asked.
Neither of the girls replied. They had previously searched the area, and even
now as they looked over every inch of the floor and the three walls
surrounding the high sides of the couch, they could detect nothing that looked
like an opening.
By this time Helen looked sheepish. "I—I guess I was wrong," she said finally.
Turning to the police guard, she said, "I'm sorry to have taken you away from
your work."
"Don't feel too badly about it. But I'd better get back to my guard duty," the
man said, and left the house.
"Oh, Nancy!" Helen cried out.  "I'm so sorry!"
She was about to say more but Nancy put a finger to her lips. They could use
the same strategy for trapping the thief at another time. In case the thief
might be listening, Nancy did not want to give away their secret.
Nancy felt that after all the uproar the ghost would not appear again that
night. She motioned to Helen that they would go quietly upstairs and get some
sleep. Hugging the walls of the stairway once more, they ascended noiselessly,
tiptoed to their room, and got into bed.
"I'm certainly glad I didn't wake up Miss Flora and Aunt Rosemary," said Helen
sleepily as she whispered good night.
Though Nancy had been sure the ghost would not enter the mansion again that
night, she discovered in the morning that she had been mistaken. More food had
been stolen sometime between midnight and eight o'clock when she and Helen
started breakfast. Had the ghost taken it for personal use or only to worry
the occupants of Twin Elms?
"I missed my chance this time," Nancy murmured to her friend. "After this, I'd
better not trust what that ghost's next move may be!"
At nine o'clock Hannah Gruen telephoned the house. Nancy happened to answer
the ring and after the usual greetings was amazed to hear Hannah say, "I'd
like to speak to your father."
"Why, Dad isn't here!" Nancy told her. "Don't you remember—the telegram said
he wasn't coming?"
"He's not there!" Hannah exclaimed. "Oh, this is bad, Nancy—very bad."
"What do you mean, Hannah?" Nancy asked fearfully.
The housekeeper explained that soon after receiving the telegram on Tuesday
evening, Mr. Drew himself had phoned. "He wanted to know if you were still in
Cliffwood, Nancy. When I told him yes, he said he would stop off there on his
way home Wednesday."
Nancy was frightened, but she asked steadily, "Hannah, did you happen to
mention the telegram to him?"

"No, I didn't," the housekeeper replied. "I didn't think it was necessary."
"Hannah darling," said Nancy, almost on the verge of tears, "I'm afraid that
telegram was a hoax!"
"A hoax!" Mrs. Gruen cried out.
"Yes. Dad's enemies sent it to keep me from meeting him!"
"Oh, Nancy," Hannah wailed, "You don't suppose those enemies that Mr. Comber
warned you about have waylaid your father and are keeping him prisoner?"
"I'm afraid so," said Nancy. Her knees began to quake and she sank into the
chair alongside the telephone table.
"What'll we do?" Hannah asked. "Do you want me to notify the police?"
"Not yet. Let me do a little checking first."
"All right, Nancy. But let me know what happens."
"I will."
Nancy put the phone down, then looked at the various telephone directories
which lay on the table. Finding one which contained River Heights numbers, she
looked for the number of the telegraph office and put in a call. She asked the
clerk who answered to verify that there had been a telegram from Mr. Drew on
Tuesday.
After a few minutes wait, the reply came. "We have no record of such a
telegram."
Nancy thanked the clerk and hung up. By this time her hands were shaking with
fright. What had happened to her father?
Getting control of herself, Nancy telephoned in turn to the airport, the
railroad station, and the bus lines which served Cliffwood. She inquired about
any accidents which might have occurred on trips from Chicago the previous day
or on Tuesday night. In each case she was told there had been none.
"Oh, what shall I do?" Nancy thought in dismay.
Immediately an idea came to her and she put in a call to the Chicago hotel
where her father had registered. Although she thought it unlikely, it was just
possible that he had changed his mind again and was still there. But a
conversation with the desk clerk dashed this hope.
"No, Mr. Drew is not here. He checked out Tuesday evening. I don't know his
plans, but I'll connect you with the head porter. He may be able to help you."
In a few seconds Nancy was asking the porter what he could tell her to help
clear up the mystery of her father's disappearance. "All I know, miss, is that
your father told me he was taking a sleeper train and getting off somewhere
Wednesday morning to meet his daughter."
"Thank you. Oh, thank you very much," said Nancy. "You've helped me a great
deal."
So her father had taken the train home and probably had reached the Cliffwood
station! Next she must find out what had happened to him after that!
Nancy told Aunt Rosemary and Helen what she had learned, then got in her
convertible and drove directly to the Cliffwood station. There she spoke to
the ticket agent. Unfortunately, he could not identify Mr. Drew from Nancy's
description as having been among the passengers who got off either of the two
trains arriving from Chicago on Wednesday.
Nancy went to speak to the taximen. Judging by the line of cabs, she decided
that all the drivers who served the station were on hand at the moment. There
had been no outgoing trains for nearly an hour and an incoming express was due
in about fifteen minutes.
"I'm in luck," the young detective told herself. "Surely one of these men must
have driven Dad."
She went from one to another, but each of them denied having carried a
passenger of Mr. Drew's description the day before.
By this time Nancy was in a panic. She hurried inside the station to a
telephone booth and called
the local police station.  Nancy asked to speak to the captain and in a moment
he came on the line.
"Captain Rossland speaking," he said crisply.
Nancy poured out her story. She told of the warning her father had received in

River Heights and her fear that some enemy of his was now detaining the lawyer
against his will.
"This is very serious, Miss Drew," Captain Rossland stated. "I will put men on
the case at once," he said.
As Nancy left the phone booth, a large, gray-haired woman walked up to her.
"Pardon me, miss, but I couldn't help overhearing what you said. I believe
maybe I can help you."
Nancy was surprised and slightly suspicious. Maybe this woman was connected
with the abductors and planned to make Nancy a prisoner too by promising to
take her to her father!
"Don't look so frightened," the woman said, smiling. "All I wanted to tell you
is that I'm down here at the station every day to take a train to the next
town. I'm a nurse and I'm on a case over there right now."
"I see," Nancy said.
"Well, yesterday I was here when the Chicago train came in. I noticed a tall,
handsome man—such as you describe your father to be—step off the train. He got
into the taxi driven by a man named Harry. I have a feeling that for some
reason the cabbie isn't telling the truth. Let's talk to him."
Nancy followed the woman, her heart beating furiously. She was ready to grab
at any straw to get a clue to her father's whereabouts!
"Hello, Miss Skade," the taximan said. "How are you today?"
"Oh, I'm all right," the nurse responded. "Listen, Harry. You told this young
lady that you didn't carry any passenger yesterday that looked like her
father. Now I saw one get into your cab. What about it?"
Harry hung his head. "Listen, miss," he said to Nancy, "I got three kids and I
don't want nothin' to happen to 'em. See?"
"What do you mean?" Nancy asked, puzzled.
When the man did not reply, Miss Skade said, "Now look, Harry. This girl's
afraid that her father has been kidnapped. It's up to you to tell her all you
know."
"Kidnapped!" the taximan shouted. "Oh, goodnight! Now I don't know what to
do."
Nancy had a sudden thought. "Has somebody been threatening you, Harry?" she
asked.
The cab driver's eyes nearly popped from his head. "Well," he said, "since
you've guessed it, I'd better tell you everything I know."
He went on to say that he had taken a passenger who fitted Mr. Drew's
description toward Twin Elms where he had said he wanted to go. "Just as we
were leaving the station, two other men came up and jumped into my cab. They
said they were going a little farther than that and would I take them? Well,
about halfway to Twin Elms, one of those men ordered me to pull up to the side
of the road and stop. He told me the stranger had blacked out. He and his
buddy jumped out of the car and laid the man on the grass."
"How ill was he?" Nancy asked.
"I don't know. He was unconscious. Just then another car came along behind us
and stopped. The driver got out and offered to take your father to a hospital.
The two men said okay."
Nancy took heart. Maybe her father was in a hospital and had not been abducted
at all But a moment later her hopes were again dashed when Harry said:
"I told those guys I'd be glad to drive the sick man to a hospital, but one of
them turned on me, shook his fist, and yelled, 'You just forget everything
that's happened or it'll be too bad for you and your kids!'"
"Oh!" Nancy cried out. and for a second everything seemed to swim before her
eyes. She clutched the door handle of the taxi for support.
There was no question now but that her father had been drugged, then
kidnapped!
The Newspaper Clue
Miss SKADE grabbed Nancy. "Do you feel ill?" the nurse asked quickly.
"Oh, I'll be all right," Nancy replied. "This news has been a great shock to
me."
"Is there any way I can help you?" the woman questioned. "I'd be very happy
to."
"Thank you, but I guess not," the young sleuth said. Smiling ruefully, she
added, "But I must get busy and do something about this."
The nurse suggested that perhaps Mr. Drew was in one of the local hospitals.
She gave Nancy the names of the three in town.
"I'll get in touch with them at once," the young detective said. "You've been
most kind. And here comes your train, Miss Skade. Good-by and again thanks a
million for your help!"
Harry climbed out of his taxi and went to stand at the platform to signal
passengers for his cab. Nancy hurried after him, and before the train came in,
asked if he would please give her a description of the two men who had been
with her father.
"Well, both of them were dark and kind of athletic-looking. Not what I'd call
handsome. One of 'em had an upper tooth missing. And the other fellow—his left
ear was kind of crinkled, if you know what I mean."
"I understand," said Nancy. "I'll give a description of the two men to the
police."
She went back to the telephone booth and called each of the three hospitals,
asking if anyone by the name of Carson Drew had been admitted or possibly a
patient who was not conscious and had no identification. Only Mercy Hospital
had a patient who had been unconscious since the day before. He definitely was
not Mr. Drew—he was Chinese!
Sure now that her father was being held in some secret hiding place, Nancy
went at once to police headquarters and related the taximan's story.
Captain Rossland looked extremely concerned. "This is alarming, Miss Drew," he
said, "but I feel sure we can trace that fellow with the crinkly ear and we'll
make him tell us where your father is I doubt, though, that there is anything
you can do. You'd better leave it to the police."
Nancy said nothing. She was reluctant to give up even trying to do something,
but she acquiesced.
"In the meantime," said the officer, "I'd advise you to remain at Twin Elms
and concentrate on solving the mystery there. From what you tell me about your
father, I'm sure he'll be able to get out of the difficulty himself, even
before the police find him."
Aloud, Nancy promised to stay on call in case Captain Rossland might need her.
But in her own mind the young sleuth determined that if she got any kind of a
lead concerning her father, she was most certainly going to follow it up.
Nancy left police headquarters and strolled up the street, deep in thought.
"Instead of things getting better, all my problems seem to be getting worse.
Maybe I'd better call Hannah."
Since she had been a little girl, Nancy had found solace in talking to Hannah
Gruen. The housekeeper had always been able to give her such good advice!
Nancy went into a drugstore and entered one of the telephone booths. She
called the Drew home in River Heights and was pleased when Mrs. Gruen
answered. The housekeeper was aghast to learn Nancy's news but said she
thought Captain Rossland's advice was sound.
"You've given the police the best leads in the world and I believe that's all
you can do. But wait—" the housekeeper suddenly said. "If I were you, Nancy,
I'd call up those railroad lawyers and tell them exactly what has happened.
Your father's disappearance is directly concerned with that bridge project,
I'm sure, and the lawyers may have some ideas about where to find him."
"That's a wonderful suggestion, Hannah," said Nancy. "I'll call them right
away."
But when the young detective phoned the railroad lawyers, she was disappointed
to learn that all the men were out to lunch and none of them would return
before two o'clock.
"Oh dear!" Nancy sighed. "Well, I guess I'd better get a snack while waiting
for them to come back." But in her worried state she did not feel like eating.

There was a food counter at the rear of the drugstore and Nancy made her way
to it. Perching on a high-backed stool, she read the menu over and over.
Nothing appealed to her. When the counterman asked her what she wanted, Nancy
said frankly she did not know—she was not very hungry-
"Then I recommend our split-pea soup," he told her.   "It's homemade and out
of this world." Nancy smiled at him. "I'll take your advice and try it."
The hot soup was delicious. By the time she had finished it, Nancy's spirits
had risen considerably.
"And how about some custard pie?" the counterman inquired. "It's just like
Mother used to make."
"All right," Nancy answered, smiling at the solicitous young man. The pie was
ice cold and proved to be delicious. When Nancy finished eating it, she
glanced at her wrist watch. It was only one-thirty. Seeing a rack of
magazines, she decided to while away the time reading in her car.
She purchased a magazine of detective stories, one of which proved to be so
intriguing that the half hour went by quickly. Promptly at two o'clock Nancy
returned to the phone booth and called the offices of the railroad lawyers.
The switchboard operator connected her with Mr. Anthony Barradale and Nancy
judged from his voice that he was fairly young. Quickly she told her story.
"Mr. Drew being held a prisoner!" Mr. Barradale cried out. "Well, those
underhanded property owners are certainly going to great lengths to gain a few
dollars."
"The police are working on the case, but I thought perhaps your firm would
like to take a hand also," Nancy told the lawyer.
"We certainly will," the young man replied. "I'll speak to our senior partner
about it. I know he will want to start work at once on the case."
"Thank you," said Nancy. She gave the address and telephone number of Twin
Elms and asked that the lawyers get in touch with her there if any news should
break.
"We'll do that," Mr. Barradale promised.
Nancy left the drugstore and walked back to her car. Climbing in, she wondered
what her next move ought to be.
"One thing is sure," she thought. "Work is the best antidote for worry. I'll
get back to Twin Elms and do some more sleuthing there."
As she drove along, Nancy reflected about the ghost entering Twin Elms mansion
by a subterranean passage. Since she had found no sign of one in any of the
outbuildings on the estate, it occurred to her that possibly it led from an
obscure cave, either natural or man-made. Such a device would be a clever
artifice for an architect to use.
Taking a little-used road that ran along one side of the estate, Nancy
recalled having seen a long, grassed-over hillock which she had assumed to be
an old aqueduct. Perhaps this was actually the hidden entrance to Twin Elms!
She parked her car at the side of the road and took a flashlight from the
glove compartment. In anticipation of finding the answer to the riddle, Nancy
crossed the field, and as she came closer to the beginning of the huge mound,
she could see stones piled up. Getting nearer, she realized that it was indeed
the entrance to a rocky cave.
"Well, maybe this time I've found it!" she thought, hurrying forward.
The wind was blowing strongly and tossed her hair about her face. Suddenly a
freakish gust swept a newspaper from among the rocks and scattered the pages
helter-skelter.
Nancy was more excited than ever. The newspaper meant a human being had been
there not too long ago! The front page sailed toward her. As she grabbed it
up, she saw to her complete astonishment that the paper was a copy of the
River Heights Gazette. The date was the Tuesday before.
"Someone interested in River Heights has been here very recently!" the young
sleuth said to herself excitedly.
Who was the person? Her father? Comber? Who?
Wondering if the paper might contain any clue, Nancy dashed around to pick up
all the sheets. As she spread them out on the ground, she noticed a hole in

the page where classified ads appeared.
"This may be a very good clue!" Nancy thought. "As soon as I get back to the
house, I'll call Hannah and have her look up Tuesday's paper to see what was
in that ad."
It suddenly occurred to Nancy that the person who had brought the paper to the
cave might be inside at this very moment. She must watch her step; he might
prove to be an enemy!
"This may be where Dad is being held a prisoner!" Nancy thought wildly.
Flashlight in hand, and her eyes darting intently about, Nancy proceeded
cautiously into the cave. Five feet, ten. She saw no one. Fifteen more.
Twenty. Then Nancy met a dead end. The empty cave was almost completely round
and had no other opening,
"Oh dear, another failure," Nancy told herself disappointedly, as she retraced
her steps. "My only hope now is to learn something important from the ad in
the paper."
Nancy walked back across the field. Her eyes were down, as she automatically
looked for footprints. But presently she looked up and stared in disbelief.
A man was standing alongside her car, examining it. His back was half turned
toward Nancy, so she could not see his face very well. But he had an athletic
build and his left ear was definitely crinkly!
The Cash
THE STRANGER inspecting Nancy's car must have heard her coming. Without
turning around, he dodged back of the automobile and started off across the
field in the opposite direction.
"He certainly acts suspiciously. He must be the man with the crinkly ear who
helped abduct my father!" Nancy thought excitedly.
Quickly she crossed the road and ran after him as fast as she could, hoping to
overtake him. But the man had had a good head start. Also, his stride was
longer than Nancy's and he could cover more ground in the same amount of time.
The far corner of the irregular-shaped field ended at the road on which
Riverview Manor stood. When Nancy reached the highway, she was just in time to
see the stranger leap into a parked car and drive off.
The young detective was exasperated.  She had had only a glimpse of the man's
profile. If only she could have seen him full face or caught the license
number of his car!
"I wonder if he's the one who dropped the newspaper?" she asked herself.
"Maybe he's from River Heights!" She surmised that the man himself was not one
of the property owners but he might have been hired by Willie Wharton or one
of the owners to help abduct Mr. Drew.
"I'd better hurry to a phone and report this," Nancy thought.
She ran all the way back across the field, stepped into her own car, turned it
around, and headed for Twin Elms. When Nancy arrived, she sped to the
telephone in the hall and dialed Cliffwood Police Headquarters. In a moment
she was talking to the captain and gave him her latest information.
"It certainly looks as if you picked up a good clue, Miss Drew," the officer
remarked. "I'll send out an alarm immediately to have this man picked up."
"I suppose there is no news of my father," Nancy said.
"I'm afraid not. But a couple of our men talked to the taxi driver Harry and
he gave us a pretty good description of the man who came along the road while
your father was lying unconscious on the grass—the one who offered to take him
to the hospital."
"What did he look, like?" Nancy asked.
The officer described the man as being in his early fifties, short, and rather
heavy-set. He had shifty pale-blue eyes.
"Well," Nancy replied, "I can think of several men who would fit that
description. Did he have any outstanding characteristics?"
"Harry didn't notice anything, except that the fellow's hands didn't look as
if he did any kind of physical work. The taximan said they were kind of soft
and pudgy."

"Well, that eliminates all the men I know who are short, heavy-set and have
pale-blue eyes. None of them has hands like that."
"It'll be a great identifying feature," the police officer remarked. "Well, I
guess I'd better get that alarm out."
Nancy said good-by and put down the phone. She waited several seconds for the
line to clear, then picked up the instrument again and called Hannah Gruen.
Before Nancy lay the sheet of newspaper from which the advertisement had been
torn.
"The Drew residence," said a voice on the phone.
"Hello, Hannah.   This is Nancy."
"How are you, dear? Any news?" Mrs. Gruen asked quickly.
"I haven't found Dad yet," the young detective replied. "And the police
haven't either. But I've picked up a couple of clues."
"Tell me about them," the housekeeper requested excitedly.
Nancy told her about the man with the crinkly ear and said she was sure that
the police would soon capture him. "If he'll only talk, we may find out where
Dad is being held."
"Oh, I hope so!" Hannah sighed. "Don't get discouraged, Nancy."
At this point Helen came into the hall, and as she passed Nancy on her way to
the stairs, smiled at her friend. The young sleuth was about to ask Hannah to
get the Drews' Tuesday copy of the River Heights Gazette when she heard a
cracking noise overhead. Immediately she decided the ghost might be at work
again.
"Hannah, I'll call you back later," Nancy said and put down the phone.
She had no sooner done this than Helen screamed, "Nancy, run! The ceiling!"
She herself started for the front door.
Nancy, looking up, saw a tremendous crack in the ceiling just above the girls'
heads. The next instant the whole ceiling crashed down on them! They were
thrown to the floor.
"Oh!" Helen moaned. She was covered with lath and plaster, and had been hit
hard on the head. But she managed to call out from under the debris, "Nancy,
are you all right?" There was no answer.
The tremendous noise had brought Miss Flora and Aunt Rosemary on a run from
the kitchen. They stared in horror at the scene before them. Nancy lay
unconscious and Helen seemed too dazed to move.
"Oh my!  Oh my!" Miss Flora exclaimed.
She and Aunt Rosemary began stepping over the lath and plaster, which by now
had filled the air with dust. They sneezed again and again but made their way
forward nevertheless.
Miss Flora, reaching Helen's side, started pulling aside chunks of broken
plaster and lath. Finally, she helped her great-granddaughter to her feet.
"Oh, my dear, you're hurt!" she said solicitously.
"I'll—be—all right—in a minute," Helen insisted, choking with the dust. "But
Nancy—"
Aunt Rosemary had already reached the unconscious girl. With lightning speed,
she threw aside the debris which almost covered Nancy. Whipping a handkerchief
from her pocket, she gently laid it over Nancy's face, so that she would not
breathe in any more of the dust.
"Helen, do you feel strong enough to help me carry Nancy into the library?"
she asked. "I'd like to lay her on the couch there."
"Oh, yes, Aunt Rosemary. Do you think Nancy is badly hurt?" she asked
worriedly.
"I hope not."
At this moment Nancy stirred.  Then her arm moved upward and she pulled the
handkerchief from her face. She blinked several times as if unable to recall
where she was.
"You'll be all right, Nancy," said Aunt Rosemary kindly. "But I don't want you
to breathe this dust. Please keep the handkerchief over your nose." She took
it from Nancy's hand and once more laid it across the girl's nostrils and
mouth.

In a moment Nancy smiled wanly. "I remember now. The ceiling fell down."
"Yes," said Helen. "It knocked you out for a few moments. I hope you're not
hurt."
Miss Flora, who was still sneezing violently, insisted that they all get out
of the dust at once. She began stepping across the piles of debris, with Helen
helping her. When they reached the library door, the elderly woman went
inside.
Helen returned to help Nancy. But by this time her friend was standing up,
leaning on Aunt Rosemary's arm. She was able to make her way across the hall
to the library. Aunt Rosemary suggested calling a doctor, but Nancy said this
would not be necessary.
"I'm so thankful you girls weren't seriously hurt," Miss Flora said. "What a
dreadful thing this is! Do you think the ghost is responsible?"
Her daughter replied at once. "No, I don't. Mother, you will recall that for
some time we have had a leak in the hall whenever it rained. And the last time
we had a storm, the whole ceiling was soaked. I think that weakened the
plaster and it fell of its own accord."
Miss Flora remarked that a new ceiling would be a heavy expense for them. "Oh
dear, more troubles all the time. But I still don't want to part with my
home."
Nancy, whose faculties by now were completely restored, said with a hint of a
smile, "Well, there's one worry you might not have any more, Miss Flora."
"What's that?"
"Mr. Gomber," said Nancy, "may not be so interested in buying this property
when he sees what happened."
"Oh, I don't know," Aunt Rosemary spoke up. "He's pretty persistent."
Nancy said she felt all right now and suggested that she and Helen start
cleaning up the hall.
Miss Flora would not hear of this. "Rosemary and I are going to help," she
said determinedly.
Cartons were brought from the cellar and one after the other was filled with
the debris. After it had all been carried outdoors, mops and dust cloths were
brought into use. Within an hour all the gritty plaster dust had been removed.
The weary workers had just finished their job when the telephone rang. Nancy,
being closest to the instrument, answered it. Hannah Gruen was calling.
"Nancy! What happened?" she asked. "I've been waiting over an hour for you to
call me back. "What's the matter?"
Nancy gave her all the details.
"What's going to happen to you next?" the housekeeper exclaimed.
The young sleuth laughed. "Something good, I hope."
She asked Hannah to look for her copy of the River Heights Gazette of the
Tuesday before. In a few minutes the housekeeper brought it to the phone and
Nancy asked her to turn to page fourteen. "That has the classified ads," she
said. "Now tell me what the ad is right in the center of the page."
"Do you mean the one about used cars?"
"That must be it," Nancy replied. "That's not in my paper."
Hannah Gruen said it was an ad for Aken's, a used-car dealer. "He's at 24 Main
Street in Hancock."
"And now turn the page and tell me what ad is on the back of it," Nancy
requested.
"It's a story about a school picnic," Hannah told her. "Does either one of
them help you?"
"Yes, Hannah, I believe you've given me just the information I wanted. This
may prove to be valuable. Thanks a lot."
After Nancy had finished the call, she started to dial police headquarters,
then changed her mind. The ghost might be hiding somewhere in the house to
listen—or if he had installed microphones at various points, any conversations
could be picked up and recorded on a machine a distance away.
"It would be wiser for me to discuss the whole matter in person with the
police, I'm sure," Nancy decided.

Divulging her destination only to Helen, she told the others she was going to
drive downtown but would not be gone long.
"You're sure you feel able?" Aunt Rosemary asked her.
"I'm perfectly fine," Nancy insisted.
She set off in the convertible, hopeful that through the clue of the used-car
dealer, the police might be able to pick up the name of one of the suspects.
"They can track him down and through the man locate my father!"
An Urgent Message
"EXCELLENT! " Captain Rossland said after Nancy had told her story. He smiled,
"The way you're building up clues, if you were on my force, I'd recommend a
citation for you!"
The young sleuth smiled and thanked him. *1 must find my father," she said
earnestly,
“I'll call Captain McGinnis of the River Heights force at once," the officer
told her. ''Why don't you sit down here and wait? It shouldn't take long for
them to get information from, Aken's used car lot,"
Nancy agreed and took a chair in a corner of the Captain's office. Presently
he called to her.
"I have your answer, Miss Drew."
She jumped up and went over to his desk, The officer told her that Captain
McGinnis in River Heights had been most co-operative. He had sent two men at
once to Aken's used-car lot. They had just returned with a report.
"Day before yesterday an athletic-looking man with a crinkly ear came there
and purchased a car. He showed a driver's license stating that he was Samuel
Greenman from Huntsville."
Nancy was excited over the information. "Then it will be easy to pick him up,
won't it?" she asked.
"I'm afraid not," Captain Rossland replied. "McGinnis learned from the
Huntsville police that although Greenman is supposed to live at the address he
gave, he is reported to have been out of town for some time."
"Then no one knows where he is?"
"Not any of his neighbors."
The officer also reported that Samuel Greenman was a person of questionable
character. He was wanted on a couple of robbery charges, and police in several
states had been alerted to be on the lookout for him.
"Well, if the man I saw at my car is Samuel Greenman, then maybe he's hiding
in this area."
Captain Rossland smiled. "Are you going to suggest next that he is the ghost
at Twin Elms?"
"Who knows?" Nancy countered.
"In any case," Captain Rossland said, "your idea that he may be hiding out
around here is a good one."
Nancy was about to ask the officer another question when his phone rang. A
moment later he said, "It's for you, Miss Drew."
The girl detective picked up the receiver and said, "Hello." The caller was
Helen Corning and her voice sounded frantic.
"Oh, Nancy, something dreadful has happened here! You must come home at once!"
"What is it?" Nancy cried out, but Helen had already put down the instrument
at her end.
Nancy told Captain Rossland of the urgent request and said she must leave at
once.
"Let me know if you need the police," the officer called after her.
"Thank you, I will."
Nancy drove to Twin Elms as fast as the law allowed. As she pulled up in front
of the house, she was startled to see a doctor's car there. Someone had been
taken ill!
Helen met her friend at the front door. "Nancy," she said in a whisper, "Miss
Flora may have had a heart attack!"
"How terrible!" Nancy said, shocked. "Tell me all about it."

"Dr. Morrison wants Miss Flora to go to the hospital right away, but she
refuses. She says she won't leave here."
Helen said that the physician was still upstairs attending her
great-grandmother.
"When did she become ill?" Nancy asked. "Did something in particular bring on
the attack?*'
Helen nodded. "Yes. It was very frightening. Miss Flora, Aunt Rosemary, and I
were in the kitchen talking about supper. They wanted to have a special dish
to surprise you, because they knew you were dreadfully upset."
"That was sweet of them," Nancy remarked. "Please go on, Helen."
"Miss Flora became rather tired and Aunt Rosemary suggested that she go
upstairs and lie down. She had just started up the stairway, when, for some
unknown reason, she turned to look back. There, in the parlor, stood a man!"
"A caller?" Nancy questioned.
"Oh, no!" Helen replied. "Miss Flora said he was an ugly, horrible-looking
person. He was unshaven and his hair was kind of long."
"Do you think he was the ghost?" Nancy inquired.
"Miss Flora thought so. Well, she didn't scream. You know, she's really
terribly brave. She just decided to go down and meet him herself. And then,
what do you think?"
"I could guess any number of things," Nancy replied. "What did happen?"
Helen said that when Mrs. Turnbull had reached the parlor, no one was in it!
"And there was no secret door open."
"What did Miss Flora do then?" Nancy asked.
"She fainted."
At this moment a tall, slender, gray-haired man, carrying a physician's bag,
walked down the stairs to the front hall. Helen introduced Nancy to him, then
asked about the patient.
"Well, fortunately, Miss Flora is going to be all right," said Dr. Morrison.
"She is an amazing woman. With complete rest and nothing more to worry her, I
believe she will be all right. In fact, she may be able to be up for short
periods by this time tomorrow."
"Oh, I'm so relieved," said Helen. "I'm terribly fond of my great-grandmother
and I don't want anything to happen to her."
The physician smiled. "I'll do all I can, but you people will have to help."
"How can we do that?" Nancy asked quickly.
The physician said that no one was to talk about the ghost. "Miss Flora says
that she saw a man in the parlor and that he must have come in by some secret
entrance. Now you know, as well as I do, that such a thing is not plausible."
"But the man couldn't have entered this house any other way," Helen told him
quickly. "Every window and door on this first floor is kept locked."
The doctor raised his eyebrows. "You've heard of hallucinations?" he asked.
Nancy and Helen frowned, but remained silent.
They were sure that Miss Flora had not had an hallucination. If she had said
there was a man in the parlor, then one had been there!
"Call me if you need me before tomorrow morning," the doctor said as he moved
toward the front door. "Otherwise I'll drop in some time before twelve."
After the medic had left, the two girls exchanged glances. Nancy said, "Are
you game to search the parlor again?"
"You bet I am," Helen responded. "Shall we start now or wait until after
supper?"
Although Nancy was eager to begin at once, she thought that first she should
go upstairs and extend her sympathy to Miss Flora. She also felt that a delay
in serving her supper while the search went on might upset the ill woman.
Helen offered to go into the kitchen at once and start preparing the meal.
Nancy nodded and went up the steps.
Miss Flora had been put to bed in her daughter's room to avoid any further
scares from die ghost, who seemed to operate in the elderly woman's own room.
"Miss Flora, I'm so sorry you have to stay in bed," said Nancy, walking up and
smiling at the patient.

"Well, I am too," Mrs. Turnbull replied. "And I think it's a lot of nonsense.
Everybody faints once in a while. If you'd ever seen what I did—that horrible
face!"
"Mother!" pleaded Aunt Rosemary, who was seated in a chair on the other side
of the bed. "You know what the doctor said."
"Oh, these doctors!" her mother said pettishly. "Anyway, Nancy, I'm sure I saw
the ghost. Now you just look for a man who hasn't shaved in goodness knows how
long and has an ugly face and kind of longish hair."
It was on the tip of Nancy's tongue to ask for information on the man's height
and size, but recalling the doctor's warning, she said nothing about this.
Instead, she smiled and taking one of Miss Flora's hands in her own, said:
"Let's not talk any more about this until you're up and well. Then I'll put
you on the Drew and Company detective squad!"
The amusing remark made the elderly woman smile and she promised to try
getting some rest.
"But first I want something to eat," she demanded. "Do you think you girls can
manage alone? I'd like Rosemary to stay here with me."
"Of course we can manage, and we'll bring you exactly what you should have to
eat."
Nancy went downstairs and set up a tray for Miss Flora. On it was a cup of
steaming chicken bouillon, a thin slice of well-toasted bread, and a saucer of
plain gelatin.
A few minutes later Helen took another tray upstairs with a more substantial
meal on it for Aunt Rosemary. Then the two girls sat down in the dining room
to have their own supper. After finishing it, they quickly washed and dried
all the dishes, then started for the parlor.
"Where do you think we should look?" Helen whispered.
During the past half hour Nancy had been going over in her mind what spot in
the parlor they might have overlooked—one which could possibly have an opening
behind it. She had decided on a large cabinet built into the wall. It
contained a beautiful collection of figurines, souvenirs from many places, and
knickknacks of various kinds.
"I'm going to look for a hidden spring that may move the cabinet away from the
wall," Nancy told Helen in a low voice.
For the first time she noticed that each of the figurines and knickknacks were
set in small depressions on the shelves. Nancy wondered excitedly if this had
been done so that the figurines would not fall over in case the cabinet were
moved.
Eagerly she began to look on the back wall of the interior of the cabinet for
a spring. She and Helen together searched every inch of the upper part but
found no spring to move the great built-in piece of furniture.
On the lower part of the cabinet were two doors which Nancy had already opened
many times. But then she had been looking for a large opening.
Now she was hoping to locate a tiny spring or movable panel.
Helen searched the left side, while Nancy took the right. Suddenly her pulse
quickened in anticipation. She had felt a spot slightly higher than the rest.
Nancy ran her fingers back and forth across the area which was about half an
inch high and three inches long.
"It may conceal something," she thought, and pushed gently against the wood.
Nancy felt a vibration in the whole cabinet
"Helen! I've found something!" she whispered hoarsely. "Better stand back!"
Nancy pressed harder. This time the right side of the cabinet began to move
forward. Nancy jumped up from her knees and stood back with Helen. Slowly,
very slowly, one end of the cabinet began to move into the parlor, the other
into an open space behind it.
Helen grabbed Nancy's hand in fright. What were they going to find in the
secret passageway?
A New Suspect
THE GREAT crystal chandelier illuminated the narrow passageway behind the

cabinet. It was not very long. No one was in it and the place was dusty and
filled with cobwebs.
"There's probably an exit at the other end of this," said Nancy. "Let's see
where it goes."
"I think I'd better wait here, Nancy," Helen suggested. "This old cabinet
might suddenly start to close itself. If it does, I'll yell so you can get out
in time."
Nancy laughed. "You're a real pal, Helen."
As Nancy walked along the passageway, she looked carefully at the two walls
which lined it. There was no visible exit from either of the solid, plastered
walls. The far end, too, was solid, but this wall had been built of wood.
Nancy felt it might have some significance. At the moment she could not figure
it out and started to return to the parlor. Halfway along the narrow corridor,
she saw a folded piece of paper lying on the floor.
"This may prove something," she told herself eagerly, picking it up.
Just as Nancy stepped back into the parlor, Aunt Rosemary appeared. She stared
in astonishment at the opening in the wall and at the cabinet which now stood
at right angles to it.
"You found something?" she asked.
"Only this," Nancy replied, and handed Aunt Rosemary the folded paper.
As the girls looked over her shoulder, Mrs. Hayes opened it. "This is an
unfinished letter," she commented, then started to decipher the old-fashioned
handwriting. "Why, this was written way back in 1785—not long after the house
was built."
The note read:
My honorable friend Benjamin:
The disloyalty of two of my servants has first come to my attention. I am
afraid they plan to harm the cause of the Colonies. I will have them properly
punished. My good fortune in learning about this disloyalty came while I was
at my listening post. Every word spoken in the servants' sitting room can be
overheard by me.
I will watch for further—
The letter ended at this point Instantly Helen said, "Listening post?"
"It must be at the end of this passageway," Nancy guessed. "Aunt Rosemary,
what room would connect with it?"
"I presume the kitchen," Mrs. Hayes replied. "And it seems to me that I once
heard that the present kitchen was a sitting room for the servants long ago.
You recall that back in Colonial days food was never cooked in a mansion. It
was always prepared in another building and brought in on great trays."
Helen smiled. "With a listening post the poor servants here didn't have a
chance for a good chitchat together. Their conversations were never a secret
from their master!"
Nancy and Aunt Rosemary smiled too and nodded, then the young sleuth said,
"Let's see if this listening post still works."
It was arranged that Helen would go into the kitchen and start talking. Nancy
would stand at the end of the corridor to listen. Aunt Rosemary, who was shown
how to work the hidden spring on the cabinet, would act as guard if the great
piece of furniture suddenly started to move and close the opening.
"All ready?" Helen asked. She moved out of the room.
When she thought Nancy was at her post, she began to talk about her
forthcoming wedding and asked Nancy to be in the bridal party.
"I can hear Helen very plainly!" Nancy called excitedly to Aunt Rosemary. "The
listening post is as good as ever!"
When the test was over, and the cabinet manually closed by Nancy, she and
Helen and Aunt Rosemary held a whispered conversation. They all decided that
the ghost knew about the passageway and had overheard plans which those in the
house were making. Probably this was where the ghost disappeared after Miss
Flora spotted him.
"Funny that we seem to do more planning while we're in the kitchen than in any
other room," Aunt Rosemary remarked.

Helen said she wondered if this listening post was unique with the owner and
architect of Twin Elms mansion.
"No, indeed," Aunt Rosemary told her. "Many old homes where there were
servants had such places. Don't forget that our country has been involved in
several wars, during which traitors and spies found it easy to get information
while posing as servants."
"Very clever," Helen remarked. "And I suppose a lot of the people who were
caught never knew how they had been found out."
"No doubt," said Aunt Rosemary.
At that moment they heard Miss Flora's feeble voice calling from the bedroom
and hurried up the steps to be sure that she was all right. They found her
smiling, but she complained that she did not like to stay alone so long.
"I won't leave you again tonight, Mother," Aunt Rosemary promised. "I'm going
to sleep on the couch in this room so as not to disturb you. Now try to get a
little sleep."
The following morning Nancy had a phone call from Hannah Gruen, whose voice
sounded very irate. "I've just heard from Mr. Barradale, the railroad lawyer,
Nancy. He lost your address and phone number, so he called here. I'm furious
at what he had to say. He hinted that your father might be staying away on
purpose because he wasn't able to produce Willie Wharton!"
Nancy was angry too. "Why, that's absolutely unfair and untrue," she cried.
"Well, I just wouldn't stand for it if I were you," Hannah Gruen stated
flatly. "And that's only half of it."
"You mean he had more to say about Dad?" Nancy questioned quickly.
"No, not that," the housekeeper answered. "He was calling to say that the
railroad can't hold up the bridge project any longer. If some new evidence
isn't produced by Monday, the railroad will be forced to accede to the demands
of Willie Wharton and all those other property owners!"
"Oh, that would be a great blow to Dad!" said
Nancy. "He wouldn't want this to happen. He's sure that the signature on that
contract of sale is Willie Wharton's. All he has to do is find him and prove
it."
"Everything is such a mess," said Mrs. Gruen. "I was talking to the police
just before I called you and they have no leads at all to where your father
might be."
"Hannah, this is dreadful" said Nancy. "I don't know how, but I intend to find
Dad—and quickly, too!"
After the conversation between herself and the housekeeper was over, Nancy
walked up and down the hall, as she tried to formulate a plan. Something must
be done!
Suddenly Nancy went to the front door, opened it, and walked outside. She
breathed deeply of the lovely morning air and headed for the rose garden. She
let the full beauty of the estate sink into her consciousness, before
permitting herself to think further about the knotty problem before her.
Long ago Mr. Drew had taught Nancy that the best way to clear one's brain is
to commune with Nature for a time. Nancy went up one walk and down another,
listening to the twittering of the birds and now and then the song of the
meadow lark. Again she smelled deeply of the roses and the sweet wisteria
which hung over a sagging arbor.
Ten minutes later she returned to the house and sat down on the porch steps.
Almost at once a mental image of Nathan Comber came to her as dearly as if the
man had been standing in front of her. The young sleuth's mind began to put
together the various pieces of the puzzle regarding him and the railroad
property.
"Maybe Nathan Comber is keeping Willie Wharton away!" she said to herself.
"Willie may even be a prisoner! And if Comber is that kind of a person, maybe
he engineered the abduction of my father!"
The very thought frightened Nancy. Leaping up, she decided to ask the police
to have Nathan Comber shadowed.
"I'll go down to headquarters and talk to Captain Rossland," she decided. "And

I'll ask Helen to go along. The cleaning woman is here, so she can help Aunt
Rosemary in case of an emergency."
Without explaining her real purpose in wanting to go downtown, Nancy merely
asked Helen to accompany her there for some necessary marketing. The two girls
drove off, and on the way to town Nancy gave Helen full details of her latest
theories about Nathan Comber.
Helen was amazed. "And here he was acting so worried about your father's
safety!"
When the girls reached police headquarters, they had to wait a few minutes to
see Captain Rossland. Nancy fidgeted under the delay. Every moment seemed
doubly precious now. But finally the girls were ushered inside and the officer
greeted them warmly.
"Another clue, Miss Drew?" he asked with a smile.
Nancy told her story quickly.
"I think you're on the right track," the officer stated. "I'll be very glad to
get in touch with your Captain McGinnis in River Heights and relay your
message. And I'll notify all the men on my force to be on the lookout for this
Nathan Comber."
"Thank you," said Nancy gratefully. "Every hour that goes by I become more and
more worried about my father."
"A break should come soon," the officer told her kindly. "The minute I hear
anything I'll let you know."
Nancy thanked him and the girls went on their way. It took every bit of
Nancy's stamina not to show her inmost feelings. She rolled the cart through
the supermarket almost automatically, picking out needed food items. Her mind
would say, "We need more canned peas because the ghost took what we had," and
at the meat counter she reflected, "Dad loves thick, juicy steaks."
Finally the marketing was finished and the packages stowed in the rear of the
convertible. On the way home, Helen asked Nancy what plans she had for
pursuing the mystery.
"To tell the truth, I've been thinking about it continuously, but so far I
haven't come up with any new ideas," Nancy answered. "I'm sure, though, that
something will pop up."
When the girls were a little distance from the entrance to the Twin Elms
estate, they saw a car suddenly pull out of the driveway and make a right
turn. The driver leaned out his window and looked back. He wore a smug grin.
"Why, it's Nathan Gomber!" Nancy cried out.
"And did you see that smirk on his face?" Helen asked. "Oh, Nancy, maybe that
means he's finally persuaded Miss Flora to sell the property to him!"
"Yes," Nancy replied grimly. "And also, here I've just asked the police to
shadow him and I'm the first person to see him!"
With that Nancy put on speed and shot ahead. As she passed the driveway to the
estate, Helen asked, "Where are you going?"
"I'm following Nathan Comber until I catch him!"
Sold!
"On, NANCY, I hope we meet a police officer!" said Helen Corning. "If Comber
is a kidnaper, he may try to harm us if we do catch up to him!"
"We'll have to be cautious," Nancy admitted. "But I'm afraid we're not going
to meet any policeman. I haven't seen one on these roads in all the time I've
been here."
Both girls watched the car ahead of them intently. It was near enough for
Nancy to be able to read the license number. She wondered if the car was
registered under Comber's name or someone else's. If it belonged to a friend
of his, this fact might lead the police to another suspect
"Where do you think Comber's going?" Helen asked presently. "To meet
somebody?"
"Perhaps. And he may be on his way back to River Heights."
"Not yet," Helen said, for at that moment Comber had reached a crossroads and
turned sharp right. "That road leads away from River Heights."

"But it does lead past Riverview Manor," Nancy replied tensely as she neared
the crossroads.
Turning right, the girls saw Comber ahead, tearing along at a terrific speed.
He passed the vacant mansion. A short distance beyond it he began to turn his
car lights off and on.
"What's he doing that for?" Helen queried. "Is he just testing his lights?"
Nancy was not inclined to think so. "I believe he's signaling to someone. Look
all around, Helen, and see if you can spot anybody." She herself was driving
so fast that she did not dare take her eyes from the road.
Helen gazed right and left, and then turned to gaze through the back window.
"I don't see a soul," she reported.
Nancy began to feel uneasy. It was possible that Comber might have been
signaling to someone to follow the girls. "Helen, keep looking out the rear
window and see if a car appears and starts to follow us."
"Maybe we ought to give up the chase and just tell the police about Comber,"
Helen said a bit fearfully.
But Nancy did not want to do this. "I think it will help us a lot to know
where he's heading."
She continued the pursuit and several miles farther on came to the town of
Hancock.
"Isn't this where that crinkly-eared fellow lives?" Helen inquired.
"Yes."
"Then it's my guess Comber is going to see him."
Nancy reminded her friend that the man was reported to be out of town,
presumably because he was wanted by the police on a couple of robbery charges.
Though Hancock was small, there was a great deal of traffic on the main
street. In the center of town at an intersection, there was a signal light.
Comber shot through the green, but by the time Nancy reached the spot, the
light had turned red.
"Oh dear!" she fumed. "Now I'll probably lose him!"
In a few seconds the light changed to green and Nancy again took up her
pursuit. But she felt that at this point it was futile. Comber could have
turned down any of a number of side streets, or if he had gone straight
through the town he would now be so far ahead of her that it was doubtful she
could catch him. Nancy went on, nevertheless, for another three miles. Then,
catching no sight of her quarry, she decided to give up the chase.
"I guess it's hopeless, Helen," she said. "I'm going back to Hancock and
report everything to the police there. I'll ask them to get in touch with
Captain Rossland and Captain McGinnis."
"Oh, I hope they capture Comber 1" Helen said. "He's such a horrible man! He
ought to be put in jail just for his bad manners!"
Smiling, Nancy turned the car and headed back for Hancock. A woman passer-by
gave her directions to police headquarters and a few moments later Nancy
parked in front of it. The girls went inside the building. Nancy told the
officer in charge who they were, then gave him full details of the recent
chase.
The officer listened attentively, then said, "I'll telephone your River
Heights captain first."
"And please alert your own men and the State Police," Nancy requested.
He nodded. "Don't worry, Miss Drew, I'll follow through from here." He picked
up his phone.
Helen urged Nancy to leave immediately. "While you were talking, I kept
thinking about Comber's visit to Twin Elms. I have a feeling something may
have happened there. You remember what a self-satisfied look Comber had on his
face when we saw him come out of the driveway."
"You're right," Nancy agreed. "We'd better hurry back there."
It was a long drive back to Twin Elms and the closer the girls go to it, the
more worried they became. "Miss Flora was already ill," Helen said tensely,
"and Comber's visit may have made her worse."
On reaching the house, the front door was opened by Aunt Rosemary, who looked
       
pale.
"I'm so glad you've returned," she said. "My mother is much worse. She has had
a bad shock. I'm waiting for Dr. Morrison."
Mrs. Hayes’ voice was trembling and she found it hard to go on. Nancy said
sympathetically, "We know Nathan Comber was here. We've been chasing his car,
but lost it. Did he upset Miss Flora?"
"Yes. I was out of the house about twenty minutes talking with the gardener
and didn't happen to see Comber drive up. The cleaning woman, Lillie, let him
in. Of course she didn't know who he was and thought he was all right. When
she finally came outside to tell me, I had walked way over to the wisteria
arbor at the far end of the grounds.
"In the meantime, Comber went upstairs. He began talking to Mother about
selling the mansion. When she refused, he threatened her, saying that if she
did not sign, all kinds of dreadful things would happen to me and to both you
girls.
"Poor mother couldn't hold out any longer. At this moment Lillie, who couldn't
find me, returned and went upstairs. She actually witnessed Mother's signature
on the contract of sale and signed her own name to it. So Comber has won!"
Aunt Rosemary sank into the chair by the telephone and began to cry. Nancy and
Helen put their arms around her, but before either could say a word of
comfort, they heard a car drive up in front of the mansion. At once Mrs. Hayes
dried her eyes and said, "It must be Dr. Morrison."
Nancy opened the door and admitted the physician. The whole group went
upstairs where Miss Flora lay staring at the ceiling like someone in a trance.
She was murmuring:
"I shouldn't have signed! I shouldn't have sold Twin Elms!"
Dr. Morrison took the patient's pulse and listened to her heartbeat with a
stethoscope. A few moments later he said, "Mrs. Turnbull, won't you please let
me take you to the hospital?"
"Not yet," said Miss Flora stubbornly. She smiled wanly. "I know I'm ill. But
I'm not going to get better any quicker in the hospital than I am right here.
I'll be moving out of Twin Elms soon enough and I want to stay here as long as
I can. Oh, why did I ever sign my name to that paper?"
As an expression of defeat came over the physician's face, Nancy moved to the
bedside. "Miss Flora," she said gently, "maybe the deal will never go through.
In the first place, perhaps we can prove that you signed under coercion. If
that doesn't work, you know it takes a long time to have a title search made
on property. By then, maybe Comber will change his mind."
"Oh, I hope you're right," the elderly woman replied, squeezing Nancy's hand
affectionately.
The girls left the room, so that Dr. Morrison could examine the patient
further and prescribe for her. They decided to say nothing of their morning's
adventure to Miss Flora, but at luncheon they gave Aunt Rosemary a full
account.
"I'm almost glad you didn't catch Comber." Mrs. Hayes exclaimed. "He might
have harmed you both."
Nancy said she felt sure that the police of one town or the other would soon
capture him, and then perhaps many things could be explained. "For one, we can
find out why he was turning his lights off and on. I have a hunch he was
signaling to someone and that the person was hidden in Riverview Manor!"
"You may be right," Aunt Rosemary replied.
Helen suddenly leaned across the table. "Do you suppose our ghost thief hides
out there?"
"I think it's very probable," Nancy answered. "I'd like to do some sleuthing
in that old mansion."
"You're not going to break in?" Helen asked, horrified.
Her friend smiled. "No, Helen, I'm not going to evade the law. I'll go to the
realtor who is handling the property and ask him to show me the place. Want to
come along?"
Helen shivered a little but said she was game. "Let's do it this afternoon."

"Oh dear." Aunt Rosemary gave an anxious sigh. "I don't know whether or not I
should let you. It sounds very dangerous to me."
"If the realtor is with us, we should be safe," Helen spoke up. Her aunt then
gave her consent, and added that the realtor, Mr. Dodd, had an office on Main
Street.
Conversation ceased for a few moments as the threesome finished luncheon. They
had just left the table when they heard a loud thump upstairs.
"Oh, goodness!" Aunt Rosemary cried out. "I hope Mother hasn't fallen!"
She and the girls dashed up the stairs. Miss Flora was in bed, but she was
trembling like a leaf in the wind. She pointed a thin, white hand toward the
ceiling.
"It was up in the attic!  Somebody’s there!"
Through the Trap Door
"LET'S find out who's in the attic!" Nancy urged as she ran from the room,
Helen at her heels.
"Mother, will you be all right if I leave you a few moments?" Aunt Rosemary
asked. "I'd like to go with the girls."
"Of course. Run along."
Nancy and Helen were already on their way to the third floor. They did not
bother to go noiselessly, but raced up the center of the creaking stairs.
Reaching the attic, they lighted two of the candles and looked around. They
saw no one, and began to look behind trunks and pieces of furniture. Nobody
was hiding.
"And there's no evidence," said Nancy, "that the alarming thump was caused by
a falling box or carton."
"There's only one answer," Helen decided. "The ghost was here. But how did he
get in?"
The words were scarcely out of her mouth when the group heard a man's
spine-chilling laugh. It had not come from downstairs.
"He—he's back of the wall!" Helen gasped fearfully. Nancy agreed, but Aunt
Rosemary said, "That laugh could have come from the roof."
Helen looked at her aunt questioningly. "You —you mean that the ghost swings
onto the roof from a tree and climbs in here somehow?"
"I think it very likely," her aunt replied. "My father once told, my mother
that there's a trap door to the roof. I never saw it and I forgot having heard
of it until this minute."
Holding their candles high, the girls examined every inch of the peaked,
beamed ceiling. The rafters were set close together with wood panels between
them.
"I see something that might be a trap door!" Nancy called out presently from
near one end of the attic. She showed the others where some short panels
formed an almost perfect square.
"But how does it open?" Helen asked. "There's no knob or hook or any kind of
gadget to grab hold of."
"It might have been removed, or rusted off," Nancy said.
She asked Helen to help her drag a high wooden box across the floor until it
was directly under the suspected section and Nancy stepped up onto it.
Focusing her light on the four edges of the panels, the young sleuth finally
discovered a piece of metal wedged between two of the planks.
"I think I see a way to open this," Nancy said, "but I'll need some tools."
"I'll get the ones I found before," Helen offered.
She hurried downstairs and procured them. Nancy tried one tool after another,
but none would work; they were either too wide to fit into the crack or they
would not budge the piece of metal either up or down.
Nancy looked down at Aunt Rosemary. "Do you happen to have an old-fashioned
buttonhook?" she asked. "That might be just the thing for this job."
"Indeed I have—in fact, Mother has several of them. I'll get one."
Aunt Rosemary was gone only a few minutes. Upon her return, she handed Nancy a
long, silver-handled buttonhook inscribed with Mrs. Turn-bull's initials.

"Mother used this to fasten her high button shoes. She has a smaller matching
one for glove buttons. In olden days," she told the girls, "no lady's gloves
were the pull-on type. They all had buttons."
Nancy inserted the long buttonhook into the ceiling crack and almost at once
was able to grasp the piece of metal and pull it down. Now she began tugging
on it. When nothing happened, Helen climbed up on the box beside her friend
and helped pull
Presently there was a groaning, rasping noise and the square section of the
ceiling began to move downward. The girls continued to yank on the metal piece
and slowly a folded ladder attached to the wood became visible.
"The trap door's up there!" Helen cried gleefully, looking at the roof.
"Nancy, you shall have the honor of being the first one to look out."
Nancy smiled. "And, you mean, capture the ghost?"
As the ladder was straightened out, creaking with each pull, and set against
the roof, Nancy felt sure, however, that the ghost did not use it. The ladder
made entirely too much noise! She also doubted that he was on the roof, but it
would do no harm to look. She might pick up a clue of some sort!
"Well, here I go," Nancy said, and started to ascend the rungs.
When she reached the top, Nancy unfastened the trap door and shoved it upward.
She poked her head outdoors and looked around. No one was in sight on the
roof, but in the center stood a circular wooden lookout. It occurred to Nancy
that possibly the ghost might be hiding in it!
She called down to Aunt Rosemary and Helen to look up at the attic ceiling for
evidence of an opening into the tower. They returned to Nancy in half a minute
to report that they could find no sign of another trap door.
"There probably was one in olden days," said Aunt Rosemary, "but it was closed
up."
A sudden daring idea came to the girl detective. "I'm going to crawl over to
that lookout and see if anybody's in it!" she told the two below.
Before either of them could object, she started to crawl along the ridgepole
above the wooden shingled sides of the deeply slanting roof. Helen had raced
up the ladder, and now watched her friend fearfully.
"Be careful, Nancy!" she warned.
Nancy was doing just that. She must keep a perfect balance or tumble down to
almost certain death. Halfway to the tower, the daring girl began to feel that
she had been foolhardy, but she was determined to reach her goal.
"Only five more feet to go," Nancy told herself presently.
With a sigh of relief, she reached the tower and pulled herself tip. It was
circular and had openings on each side. She looked in. No "ghost"!
Nancy decided to step inside the opening and examine the floor. She set one
foot down, but immediately the boards, rotted from the weather, gave way
beneath her.
"It's a good thing I didn't put my whole weight on it," she thought
thankfully.
"Do you see anything?" Helen called.
"Not a thing. This floor hasn't been in use for a long time."
"Then the ghost didn't come in by way of the roof," Helen stated.
Nancy nodded in agreement. "The only places left to look are the chimneys,"
the young sleuth told her friend. "I'll check them."
There were four of these and Nancy crawled to each one in turn. She looked
inside but found nothing to suggest that the ghost used any of them for entry.
Balancing herself against the last chimney. Nancy surveyed the countryside
around her. What a beautiful and picturesque panorama it was, she thought! Not
far away was a lazy little river, whose waters sparkled in the sunlight. The
surrounding fields were green and sprinkled with patches of white daisies.
Nancy looked down on the grounds of Twin Elms and tried in her mind to
reconstruct the original landscaping.
"That brick walk to the next property must have had a lovely boxwood hedge at
one time," she said to herself.
Her gaze now turned to Riverview Manor. The grounds there were overgrown with

weeds and several shutters were missing from the house. Suddenly Nancy's
attention was drawn to one of the uncovered windowpanes. Did she see a light
moving inside?
It disappeared a moment later and Nancy could not be sure. Perhaps the sun
shining on the glass had created an optical illusion.
"Still, somebody just might be in that house," the young sleuth thought. "The
sooner I get over there and see what I can find out, the better! If the ghost
is hiding out there, maybe he uses some underground passage from one of the
outbuildings on the property."
She crawled cautiously back to the trap door and together the girls closed it.
Aunt Rosemary had already gone downstairs to take care of her mother.
Nancy told Helen what she thought she had just seen in the neighboring
mansion. "I'll change my clothes right away. Then let's go see Mr. Dodd, the
realtor broker for Riverview Manor."
A half hour later the two girls walked into the real-estate office. Mr. Dodd
himself was there and Nancy asked him about looking at Riverview Manor.
"I'm sorry, miss," he said, "but the house has just been sold."
Nancy was stunned. She could see all her plans crumbling into nothingness.
Then a thought came to her. Perhaps the new owner would not object if she
looked around, anyway.
"Would you mind telling me, Mr. Dodd, who purchased Riverview Manor?"
"Not at all," the realtor replied. "A man named Nathan Comber."
A Confession
NANCY DREW'S face wore such a disappointed look that Mr. Dodd, the realtor,
said kindly, "Don't take it so hard, miss. I don't think you'd be particularly
interested in Riverview Manor. It's really not in very good condition.
Besides, you'd need a pile of money to fix that place up."
Without commenting on his statement, Nancy asked, "Couldn't you possibly
arrange for me to see the inside of the mansion?"
Mr. Dodd shook his head. "I'm afraid Mr. Comber wouldn't like that."
Nancy was reluctant to give up. Why, her father might even be a prisoner in
that very house! "Of course I can report my suspicion to the police," the
young sleuth thought.
She decided to wait until morning. Then, if there was still no news of Mr.
Drew, she would pass along the word to Captain Rossland.
Mr. Dodd's telephone rang. As he answered it, Nancy and Helen started to leave
his office. But he immediately waved them back.
"The call is from Chief Rossland, Miss Drew," he said. "He phoned Twin Elms
and learned you were here. He wants to see you at once."
"Thank you," said Nancy, and the girls left.
They hurried to police headquarters, wondering why the officer wanted to speak
to Nancy.
"Oh, if only it's news of Dad," she exclaimed fervently. "But why didn't he
get in touch with me himself?"
"I don't want to be a killjoy," Helen spoke up. "But maybe it's not about your
father at all. Perhaps they've caught Nathan Comber."
Nancy parked in front of headquarters and the two girls hurried inside the
building. Captain Rossland was expecting them and they were immediately
ushered into his office. Nancy introduced Helen Corning.
"I won't keep you in suspense," the officer said, watching Nancy's eager face.
"We have arrested Samuel Greenman!"
"The crinkly-eared man?" Helen asked.
"That's right," Captain Rossland replied. "Thanks to your tip about the used
car, Miss Drew, our men had no trouble at all locating him."
The officer went on to say, however, that the prisoner refused to confess that
he had had anything to do with Mr. Drew's disappearance.
"Furthermore, Harry the taxi driver—we have him here—insists that he cannot
positively identify Greenman as one of the passengers in his cab. We believe
Harry is scared that Greenman's pals will beat him up or attack members of his

family."
"Harry did tell me," Nancy put in, "that his passenger had threatened harm to
his family unless he forgot all about what he had seen."
"That proves our theory," Captain Rossland stated with conviction. "Miss Drew,
we think you can help the police."
"I'll be glad to. How?"
Captain Rossland smiled. "You may not know it, but you're a very persuasive
young lady. 1 believe that you might be able to get information out of both
Harry and Greenman, where we nave failed."
After a moment's thought, Nancy replied modestly, "I'll be happy to try, but
on one condition." She grinned at the officer. "I must talk to these men
alone."
"Request granted." Captain Rossland smiled. He added that he and Helen would
wait outside and he would have Harry brought in.
"Good luck," said Helen as she and the captain left the room.
A few moments later Harry walked in alone. "Oh hello, miss," he said to Nancy,
barely raising his eyes from the floor.
"Won't you sit down, Harry," Nancy asked, indictating a chair alongside hers.
"It was nice of the captain to let me talk to you."
Harry seated himself, but said nothing. He twisted his driver's tap nervously
in his hands and kept his gaze downward.
"Harry," Nancy began, "I guess your children would feel terrible if you were
kidnapped."
"It would cut 'em to pieces," the cabman stated emphatically.
"Then you know how I feel," Nancy went on. "Not a word from my father for two
whole days. If your children knew somebody who'd seen the person who kidnapped
you, wouldn't they feel bad if the man wouldn't talk?"
Harry at last raised his eyes and looked straight at Nancy. "I get you, miss.
When somethin' comes home to you, it makes all the difference in the world.
You win! I can identify that scoundrel Greenman, and I will. Call the captain
in."
Nancy did not wait a second. She opened the door and summoned the officer,
"Harry has something to tell you," Nancy said to Captain Rossland.
"Yeah," said Harry, "I'm not goin' to hold out any longer, I admit Greenman
had me scared, but he's the guy who rode in my cab, then ordered me to keep my
mouth shut after that other passenger blacked out."
Captain Rossland looked astounded. It was evident he could hardly believe that
Nancy in only a few minutes had persuaded the man to talk!
"And now," Nancy asked, "may I talk to your prisoner?"
"I'll have you taken to his cell," the captain responded, and rang for a
guard.
Nancy was led down a corridor, past a row of cells until they came to one
where the man with the crinkled ear sat on a cot.
"Greenman," said the guard, "step up here. This is Miss Nancy Drew, daughter
of the kidnapped man. She wants to talk to you."
The prisoner shuffled forward, but mumbled, "I ain't goin' to answer no
questions."
Nancy waited until the guard had moved off, then she smiled at the prisoner.
"We all make mistakes at times," she said. "We're often misled by people who
urge us to do things we shouldn't. Maybe you're afraid you'll receive the
death sentence for helping to kidnap my father. But if you didn't realize the
seriousness of the whole thing, the complaint against you may turn out just to
be conspiracy."
To Nancy's astonishment, Greenman suddenly burst out, "You've got me exactly
right, miss. I had almost nothing to do with takin' your father away. The guy
I was with—he's the old-timer. He's got a long prison record. I haven't.
Honest, miss, this is my first offense.
"I'll tell you the whole story. I met this guy only Monday night. He sure sold
me a bill of goods. But all I did was see that your pop didn't run away. The
old-timer's the one that drugged him."

"Where is my father now?" Nancy interrupted.
"I don't know. Honest I don't," Greenman insisted. "Part of the plan was for
somebody to follow the taxi. After a while Mr. Drew was to be given a whiff of
somethin'. It didn't have no smell. That's why our taxi driver didn't catch
on. And it didn't knock the rest of us out, 'cause you have to put the stuff
right under a fellow's nose to make it work."
"And the person who was following in a car and took my father away, who is
he?"
"I don't know," the prisoner answered, and Nancy felt that he was telling the
truth.
"Did you get any money for doing this?" Nancy asked him.
"A little. Not as much as it was worth, especially if I have to go to prison.
The guy who paid us for our work was the one in the car who took your father
away."
"Will you describe him?" Nancy requested.
"Sure. Hope the police catch him soon. He's in his early fifties—short and
heavy-set, pale, and has kind of watery blue eyes."
Nancy asked the prisoner if he would dictate the same confession for the
police and the man nodded. "And I'm awful sorry I caused all this worry, miss.
I hope you find your father soon and I wish I could help you more. I guess I
am a coward. I'm too scared to tell the name of the guy who talked me into
this whole thing. He's really a bad actor—no tellin’ what'd happen to me if I
gave his name."
The young sleuth felt that she had obtained all the information she possibly
could from the man. She went back to Captain Rossland, who for the second time
was amazed by the girl's success. He called a stenographer. Then he said
good-by to Nancy and Helen and went off toward Greenman's cell.
On the way back to Twin Elms, Helen congratulated her friend. "Now that one of
the kidnapers has been caught, I'm sure that your father will be found soon,
Nancy. Who do you suppose the man was who took your father from Greenman and
his friend?"
Nancy looked puzzled, then answered, "We know from his description that he
wasn't Gomber. But, Helen, a hunch of mine is growing stronger all the time
that he's back of this whole thing. And putting two and two together, I
believe it was Willie Wharton who drove that car.
"And I also believe Wharton's the one who's been playing ghost, using masks at
times—like the gorilla and the unshaven, long-haired man.
"Somehow he gets into the mansion and listens to conversations. He heard that
I was going to be asked to solve the mystery at Twin Elms and told Comber.
That's why Gomber came to our home and tried to keep me from coming here by
saying I should stick close to Dad."
"That's right," said Helen. "And when he found that didn't work, he had Willie
and Greenman and that other man kidnap your dad. He figured it would surely
get you away from Twin Elms. He wanted to scare Miss Flora into selling the
property, and he thought if you were around you might dissuade her."
"But in that I didn't succeed," said Nancy a bit forlornly. "Besides, they
knew Dad could stop those greedy land owners from forcing the railroad to pay
them more for their property. That's why I'm sure Gomber and Wharton won't
release him until after they get what they want."
Helen laid a hand on Nancy's shoulder. "I'm so terribly sorry about this. What
can we do next?"
"Somehow I have a feeling, Helen," her friend replied, "that you and I are
going to find Willie Wharton before very long. And if we do, and I find out he
really signed that contract of sale, I want certain people to be around."
"Who?" Helen asked, puzzled.
"Mr. Barradale, the lawyer, and Mr. Watson the notary public."
The young sleuth put her thought into action. Knowing that Monday was the
deadline set by the railroad, she determined to do her utmost before that time
to solve the complicated mystery. Back at Twin Elms, Nancy went to the
telephone and put in a call to Mr. Barradale's office. She did not dare

mention Comber's or Willie Wharton's name for fear one or the other of them
might be listening. She merely asked the young lawyer if he could possibly
come to Cliffwood and bring with him whatever he felt was necessary for him to
win his case.
"I think I understand what you really mean to say," he replied. "I take it you
can't talk freely. Is that correct?"
"Yes."
"Then I'll ask the questions. You want me to come to the address that you gave
us the other day?"
"Yes. About noon."
"And you'd like me to bring along the contract of sale with Willie Wharton's
signature?"
"Yes. That will be fine." Nancy thanked him and hung up.
Turning from the telephone, she went to find Helen and said, "There's still
lots of daylight. Even though we can't get inside Riverview Manor, we can hunt
through the outbuildings over there for the entrance to an underground passage
to this house."
"All right," her friend agreed. "But this time you do the searching. I'll be
the lookout."
Nancy chose the old smokehouse of Riverview Manor first, since this was
closest to the Twin Elms property line. It yielded no clue and she moved on to
the carriage house. But neither in this building, nor any of the others, did
the girl detective find any indication of entrances to an underground
passageway. Finally she gave up and rejoined Helen.
"If there is an opening, it must be from inside Riverview Manor," Nancy
stated. "Oh, Helen, it's exasperating not to be able to get in there!"
"I wouldn't go in there now in any case," Helen remarked. "It's way past
suppertime and I'm starved. Besides, pretty soon it'll be dark."
The girls returned to Twin Elms and ate supper. A short time later someone
banged the front-door knocker. Both girls went to the door. They were amazed
to find that the caller was Mr. Dodd, the realtor. He held out a large brass
key toward Nancy.
"What's this for?" she asked, mystified.
Mr. Dodd smiled.
"It's the front-door key to Riverview Manor. I've decided that you can look
around the mansion tomorrow morning all you please."
The Hidden Staircase
SEEING the look of delight on Nancy's face, Mr. Dodd laughed. "Do you think
that house is haunted as well as this one?" he asked. "I hear you like to
solve mysteries."
"Yes, I do." Not wishing to reveal her real purpose to the realtor, the young
sleuth also laughed. "Do you think I might find a ghost over there?" she
countered.
"Well, I never saw one, but you never can tell," the man responded with a
chuckle. He said he would leave the key with Nancy until Saturday evening and
then pick it up. "If Mr. Comber should show up in the meantime, I have a key
to the kitchen door that he can use."
Nancy thanked Mr. Dodd and with a grin said she would let him know if she
found a ghost at Riverview Manor.
She could hardly wait for the next morning to arrive. Miss Flora was not told
of the girls' plan to visit the neighboring house.
Immediately after breakfast, they set off for Riverview Manor. Aunt Rosemary
went with them to the back door and wished the two good luck. "Promise me you
won't take any chances," she begged.
"Promise," they said in unison.
With flashlights in their skirt pockets, Nancy and Helen hurried through the
garden and into the grounds of Riverview Manor estate.
As they approached the front porch, Helen showed signs of nervousness. "Nancy,
what will we do if we meet the ghost?" she asked.

"Just tell him we've found him out," her friend answered determinedly.
Helen said no more and watched as Nancy inserted the enormous brass key in the
lock. It turned easily and the girls let themselves into the hall.
Architecturally it was the same as Twin Elms mansion, but how different it
looked now! The blinds were closed, lending an eerie atmosphere to the dusky
interior. Dust lay everywhere, and cobwebs festooned the corners of the
ceiling and spindles of the staircase.
"It certainly doesn't look as if anybody lives here," Helen remarked. "Where
do we start hunting?"
"I want to take a look in the kitchen," said Nancy.
When they walked into it, Helen gasped. "I guess I was wrong. Someone has been
eating here." Eggshells, several empty milk bottles, some chicken bones and
pieces of waxed paper cluttered the sink.
Nancy, realizing that Helen was very uneasy, whispered to her with a giggle,
"If the ghost lives here, he has a good appetite 1"
The young sleuth took out her flashlight and beamed it around the floors and
walls of the kitchen. There was no sign of a secret opening. As she went from
room to room on the first floor, Helen followed and together they searched
every inch of the place for a clue to a concealed door. At last they came to
the conclusion there was none.
"You know, it could be in the cellar," Nancy suggested.
"Well, you're not going down there," Helen said firmly. "That is, not without
a policeman. It's too dangerous. As for myself, I want to live to get married
and not be hit over the head in the dark by that ghost, so Jim won't have a
bride!"
Nancy laughed. "You win. But I'll tell you why. At the moment I am more
interested in finding my father than in hunting for a secret passageway. He
may be a prisoner in one of the rooms upstairs. I'm going to find out."
The door to the back stairway was unlocked and the one at the top stood open.
Nancy asked
Helen to stand at the foot of the main staircase, while she herself went up
the back steps. "If that ghost is up there and tries to escape, he won't be
able to slip out that way," she explained.
Helen took her post in the front hall and Nancy crept up the back steps. No
one tried to come down either stairs. Helen now went to the second floor and
together she and Nancy began a search of the rooms. They found nothing
suspicious. Mr. Drew was not there. There was no sign of a ghost. None of the
walls revealed a possible secret opening. But the bedroom which corresponded
to Miss Flora's had a clothes closet built in at the end next to the
fireplace.
"In Colonial times closets were a rarity," Nancy remarked to Helen. "I wonder
if this closet was added at that time and has any special significance."
Quickly she opened one of the large double doors and looked inside. The rear
wall was formed of two very wide wooden planks. In the center was a round
knob, sunk in the wood.
"This is strange," Nancy remarked excitedly.
She pulled on the knob but the wall did not move. Next, she pushed the knob
down hard, leaning her full weight against the panel.
Suddenly the wall pushed inward. Nancy lost her balance and disappeared into a
gaping hole below!
Helen screamed.   "Nancy!"
Trembling with fright, Helen stepped into the closet and beamed her flashlight
below. She could see a long flight of stone steps.
"Nancy! Nancy!" Helen called down.
A muffled answer came from below. Helen's heart gave a leap of relief.
"Nancy's alive!" she told herself, then called, "Where are you?"
"I've found the secret passageway," came faintly to Helen's ears. "Come on
down."
Helen did not hesitate. She wanted to be certain that Nancy was all right.
Just as she started down the steps, the door began to close. Helen, in a panic
 
       
that the girls might be trapped in some subterranean passageway, made a wild
grab for the door. Holding it ajar, she removed the sweater she was wearing
and wedged it into the opening.
Finding a rail on one side of the stone steps, Helen grasped it and hurried
below. Nancy arose from the dank earthen floor to meet her.
"Are you sure you're all right?" Helen asked solicitously.
"I admit I got a good bang," Nancy replied, "but I feel fine now. Let's see
where this passageway goes."
The flashlight had been thrown from her hand, but with the aid of Helen's
light, she soon found it. Fortunately, it had not been damaged and she turned
it on.
The passageway was very narrow and barely high enough for the girls to walk
without bending over. The sides were built of crumbling brick and stone.
"This may tumble on us at any moment," Helen said worriedly.
"Oh, I don't believe so," Nancy answered. "It must have been here for a long
time."
The subterranean corridor was unpleasantly damp and had an earthy smell.
Moisture clung to the walls. They felt clammy and repulsive to the touch.
Presently the passageway began to twist and turn, as if its builders had found
obstructions too difficult to dig through.
"Where do you think this leads?" Helen whispered.
"I don't know. I only hope we're not going in circles."
Presently the girls reached another set of stone steps not unlike the ones
down which Nancy had tumbled. But these had solid stone sides. By their
lights, the girls could see a door at the top with a heavy wooden bar across
it.
"Shall we go up?" Helen asked.
Nancy was undecided what to do. The tunnel did not end here but yawned ahead
in blackness. Should they follow it before trying to find out what was at the
top of the stairs?
She voiced her thoughts aloud, but Helen urged that they climb the stairs.
"I'll be frank with you. I'd like to get out of here."
Nancy acceded to her friend's wish and led the way up the steps.
Suddenly both girls froze in their tracks.
A man's voice from the far end of the tunnel commanded, "Stop! You can't go up
there!"
Nancy's Victory
THEIR initial fright over, both girls turned and beamed their flashlights
toward the foot of the stone stairway. Below them stood a short, unshaven,
pudgy man with watery blue eyes.
"You're the ghost!" Helen stammered.
"And you're Mr. Willie Wharton," Nancy added.
Astounded, the man blinked in the glaring lights, then said, "Ye-yes, I am.
But how did you know?"
"You live in the old Riverview Manor," Helen went on, "and you've been
stealing food and silver and jewelry from Twin Elms!"
"No, no. I'm not a thief!" Willie Wharton cried out. "I took some food and
I've been trying to scare the old ladies, so they would sell their property.
Sometimes I wore false faces, but I never took any jewelry or silver. Honest I
didn't. It must have been Mr. Gomber."
Nancy and Helen were amazed—Willie Wharton, with little urging from them, was
confessing more than they had dared to hope.
"Did you know that Nathan Gomber is a thief?" Nancy asked the man.
Wharton shook his head. "I know he's sharp— that's why he's going to get me
more money for my property from the railroad."
"Mr. Wharton, did you sign the original contract of sale?" Nancy queried.
"Yes, I did, but Mr. Gomber said that if I disappeared, for a while, he'd fix
everything up so I'd get more money. He said he had a couple of other jobs
which I could help him with. One of them was coming here to play ghost—it was

a good place to disappear to. But I wish I had never seen Nathan Gomber or
Riverview Manor or Twin Elms or had anything to do with ghosts."
"I'm glad to hear you say that," said Nancy. Then suddenly she asked, "Where's
my father?"
Willie Wharton shifted his weight and looked about wildly. "I don't know,
really I don't."
"But you kidnapped him in your car," the young sleuth prodded him. "We got a
description of you from the taximan."
Several seconds went by before Willie Wharton answered. "I didn't know it was
kidnapping. Mr. Gomber said your father was ill and that he was going to take
him to a special doctor. He said Mr. Drew was coming on a train from Chicago
and was going to meet Mr. Comber on the road halfway between here and the
station. But Comber said he couldn't meet him—had other business to attend to.
So I was to follow your father's taxi and bring him to Riverview Manor."
"Yes, yes, go on," Nancy urged, as Willie Wharton stopped speaking and covered
his face with his hands.
"I didn't expect your father to be unconscious when I picked him up," Wharton
went on. "Well, those men in the taxi put Mr. Drew in the back, of my car and
I brought him here. Mr. Comber drove up from the other direction and said he
would take over. He told me to come right here to Twin Elms and do some
ghosting."
"And you have no idea where Mr. Comber took my father?" Nancy asked, with a
sinking feeling.
"Nope."
In a few words she pointed out Nathan Comber's real character to Willie
Wharton, hoping that if the man before her did know anything about Mr. Drew's
whereabouts which he was not telling, he would confess. But from Wharton's
emphatic answers and sincere offers to be of all the help he could in finding
the missing lawyer. Nancy concluded that Wharton was not withholding any
information.
"How did you find out about this passageway and the secret staircases?" Nancy
questioned him.
"Comber found an old notebook under a heap of rubbish in the attic of
Riverview Manor," Wharton answered. "He said it told everything about the
secret entrances to the two houses. The passageways, with openings on each
floor, were built when the houses were. They were used by the original
Turnbulls in bad weather to get from one building to the other. This stairway
was for the servants. The other two stairways were for the family. One of
these led to Mr. Turnbull's bedroom in this house. The notebook also said that
he often secretly entertained government agents and sometimes he had to hurry
them out of the parlor and hide them in the passageway when callers came."
"Where does this stairway lead?" Helen spoke up.
"To the attic of Twin Elms."' Willie Wharton gave a little chuckle, "I know,
Miss Drew, that you almost found the entrance. But the guys that built the
place were pretty clever. Every opening has heavy double doors. When you poked
that screw driver through the crack, you thought you were hitting another wall
but it was really a door."
"Did you play the violin and turn on the radio —and make that thumping noise
in the attic— and were you the one who laughed when we were up there?"
"Yes, and I moved the sofa to scare you and I even knew about the listening
post. That's how I found out all your plans and could report them to Mr.
Comber."
Suddenly it occurred to Nancy that Nathan Comber might appear on the scene at
any moment. She must get Willie Wharton away and have him swear to his
signature before he changed his mind!
"Mr. Wharton, -would you please go ahead of us up this stairway and open the
doors?" she asked. "And go into Twin Elms with us and talk to Mrs. Turnbull
and Mrs. Hayes? I want you to tell them that you've been playing ghost but
aren't going to any longer. Miss Flora has been so frightened that she's ill
and in bed."

"I'm sorry about that," Willie Wharton replied. "Sure I'll go with you. I
never want to see Nathan Comber again!"
He went ahead of the girls and took down the heavy wooden bar from across the
door. He swung it wide, pulled a metal ring in the back of the adjoining door,
then quickly stepped downward. The narrow panel opening which Nancy had
suspected of leading to the secret stairway now was pulled inward. There was
barely room alongside it to go up the top steps and into the attic. To keep
Comber from becoming suspicious if he should arrive, Nancy asked Willie
Wharton to close the secret door again.
"Helen," said Nancy, "will you please run downstairs ahead of Mr. Wharton and
me and tell Miss Flora and Aunt Rosemary the good news."
She gave Helen a three-minute start, then she and Willie Wharton followed. The
amazed women were delighted to have the mystery solved. But there was no time
for celebration.
"Mr. Barradale is downstairs to see you, Nancy," Aunt Rosemary announced.
Nancy turned to Willie Wharton. "Will you come down with me, please?"
She introduced both herself and the missing property owner to Mr. Barradale,
then went on, "Mr. Wharton says the signature on the contract of sale is his
own."
"And you'll swear to that?" the lawyer asked, turning to Willie.
"I sure will. I don't want anything more to do with this underhanded
business," Willie Wharton declared.
"I know where I can find a notary public right away," Nancy spoke up, "Do you
want me to phone him, Mr. Barradale?" she asked.
"Please do. At once."
Nancy dashed to the telephone and dialed the number of Albert Watson on Tuttle
Road. When he answered, she told him the urgency of the situation and he
promised to come over at once. Mr. Watson arrived within five minutes, with
his notary equipment. Mr. Barradale showed him the contract of sale containing
Willie Wharton's name and signature. Attached to it was the certificate of
acknowledgment.
Mr. Watson asked Willie Wharton to raise his right hand and swear that he was
the person named in the contract of sale. After this was done, the notary
public filled in the proper places on the certificate, signed it, stamped the
paper, and affixed his seal.
"Well, this is really a wonderful job, Miss Drew," Mr. Barradale praised her.
Nancy smiled, but her happiness at having accomplished a task for her father
was dampened by the fact that she still did not know where he was. Mr.
Barradale and Willie Wharton also were extremely concerned.
"I'm going to call Captain Rossland and ask him to send some policemen out
here at once," Nancy stated. "What better place for Mr. Comber to hide my
father than somewhere along that passageway? How far does it go, Mr. Wharton?"
"Mr. Comber says it goes all the way to the river, but the end of it is
completely stoned up now. I never went any farther than the stairways."
The young lawyer thought Nancy's idea a good one, because if Nathan Comber
should return to Riverview Manor and find that Willie was gone, he would try
to escape.
The police promised to come at once. Nancy had just finished talking with
Captain Rossland when Helen Corning called from the second floor,
"Nancy, can you come up here? Miss Flora insists upon seeing the hidden
staircase."
The young sleuth decided that she would just about have time to do this before
the arrival of the police. Excusing herself to Mr. Barradale, she ran up the
stairs. Aunt Rosemary had put on A rose-colored dressing gown while attending
her mother. To Nancy's amazement, Mrs. Turnbull was fully dressed and wore a
white blouse with a high collar and a black skirt.
Nancy and Helen led the way to the attic. There, the girl detective, crouching
on her knees, opened the secret door.
"And all these years I never knew it was here!" Miss Flora exclaimed.
"And I doubt that my father did or he would have mentioned it," Aunt Rosemary

added.
Nancy closed the secret door and they all went downstairs. She could hear the
front-door bell ringing and assumed that it was the police. She and Helen
hurried below. Captain Rossland and another officer stood there. They said
other men had surrounded Riverview Manor, hoping to catch Nathan Comber if he
did arrive there.
With Willie Wharton leading the way, the girls, Mr. Barradale, and the police
trooped to the attic and went down the hidden staircase to the dank passageway
below.
"! have a hunch from reading about old passageways that there may be one or
more rooms off this tunnel," Nancy told Captain Rossland.
There were so many powerful flashlights in play now that the place was almost
as bright as daylight. As the group moved along, they suddenly came to a short
stairway. Willie Wharton explained that this led to an opening back of the
sofa in the parlor. There was still another stone stairway which went up to
Miss Flora's bedroom with an opening alongside the fireplace.
The searchers went on. Nancy, who was ahead of the others, discovered a
padlocked iron door in the wall. Was it a dungeon? She had heard of such
places being used for prisoners in Colonial times.
By this time Captain Rossland had caught up to her. "Do you think your father
may be in there?" he asked.
"I'm terribly afraid so," said Nancy, shivering at the thought of what she
might find.
The officer found that the lock was very rusty. Pulling from his pocket a
penknife with various tool attachments, he soon had the door unlocked and
flung it wide. He beamed his light into the blackness beyond. It was indeed a
room without windows.
Suddenly Nancy cried out, "Dad!" and sprang ahead.
Lying on blankets on the floor, and covered with others, was Mr. Drew. He was
murmuring faintly.
"He's alive!" Nancy exclaimed, kneeling down to pat his face and kiss him.
"He's been drugged," Captain Rossland observed. "I'd say Nathan Comber has
been giving your father just enough food to keep him alive and mixing sleeping
powders in with it."
From his trousers pocket the officer brought out a small vial of restorative
and held it to Mr. Drew's nose. In a few moments the lawyer shook his head,
and a few seconds later, opened his eyes.
"Keep talking to your dad," the captain ordered Nancy.
"Dad! Wake up! You're all right! We've rescued you!"
Within a very short time Mr. Drew realized that his daughter was kneeling
beside him. Reaching out his arms from beneath the blankets, he tried to hug
her.
"We'll take him upstairs," said Captain Rossland. "Willie, open that secret
entrance to the parlor."
"Glad to be of help." Wharton hurried ahead and up the short flight of steps.
In the meantime, the other three men lifted Mr. Drew and carried him along the
passageway. By the tune they reached the stairway, Willie
Wharton had Opened the secret door behind the sofa in the parlor. Mr. Drew was
placed on the couch. He blinked, looked around, and then said in astonishment:
"Willie Wharton! How did you get here? Nancy, tell me the whole story."
The lawyer's robust health and sturdy constitution had stood him in good
stead. He recovered with amazing rapidity from his ordeal and listened in rapt
attention as one after another of those in the room related the events of the
past few days.
As the story ended, there was a knock on the front door and another police
officer was admitted. He had come to report to Captain Rossland that not only
had Nathan Comber been captured outside of Riverview Manor, and all the loot
recovered, but also that the final member of the group who had abducted Mr.
Drew had been taken into custody. Comber had admitted everything, even to
having attempted to injure Nancy and her father with the truck at the River

Heights' bridge project. He had tried to frighten Miss Flora into selling Twin
Elms because he had planned to start a housing project on the two Turn-bull
properties.
"It's a real victory for you!" Nancy's father praised his daughter proudly.
The young sleuth smiled. Although she was glad it was all over, she could not
help but look forward to another mystery to solve. One soon came her way when,
quite accidentally, she found herself involved in The Bungalow Mystery.
Miss Flora and Aunt Rosemary had come downstairs to meet Mr. Drew. While they
were talking to him, the police officer left, taking Willie Wharton with him
as a prisoner. Mr. Barradale also said good-by. Nancy and Helen slipped out of
the room and went to the kitchen.
"We'll prepare a super-duper lunch to celebrate this occasion!" said Helen
happily.
"And we can make all the plans we want," Nancy replied with a grin. "There
won't be anyone at the listening post!"

The way I figure it, everyone gets a miracle. Like, I will probably never be struck by lightning, or win a Nobel Prize, or become the dictator of a small nation in the Pacific Islands, or contract terminal ear cancer, or spontaneously combust. But if you consider all the unlikely things together, at least one of them will probably happen to each of us. I could have seen it rain frogs. I could have stepped foot on Mars. I could have been eaten by a whale. I could have married the queen of England or survived months at sea. But my miracle was different. My miracle was this: out of all the houses in all the subdivisions in all of Florida, I ended up living next door to Margo Roth Spiegelman.
 
Our subdivision, Jefferson Park, used to be a navy base. But then the navy didn’t need it anymore, so it returned the land to the citizens of Orlando, Florida, who decided to build a massive subdivision, because that’s what Florida does with land. My parents and Margo’s parents ended up moving next door to one another just after the first houses were built. Margo and I were two.

Before Jefferson Park was a Pleasantville, and before it was a navy base, it belonged to an actual Jefferson, this guy Dr. Jefferson Jefferson. Dr. Jefferson Jefferson has a school named after him in Orlando and also a large charitable foundation, but the fascinating and unbelievable-but-true thing about Dr. Jefferson Jefferson is that he was not a doctor of any kind. He was just an orange juice salesman named Jefferson Jefferson. When he became rich and powerful, he went to court, made “Jefferson” his middle name, and then changed his first name to “Dr.” Capital D. Lowercase r. Period.
 
So Margo and I were nine. Our parents were friends, so we would sometimes play together, biking past the cul-de-sacced streets to Jefferson Park itself, the hub of our subdivision’s wheel.
I always got very nervous whenever I heard that Margo was about to show up, on account of how she was the most fantastically gorgeous creature that God had ever created. On the morning in question, she wore white shorts and a pink T-shirt that featured a green dragon breathing a fire of orange glitter. It is difficult to explain how awesome I found this T-shirt at the time.
Margo, as always, biked standing up, her arms locked as she leaned above the handlebars, her purple sneakers a circuitous blur. It was a steam-hot day in March. The sky was clear, but the air tasted acidic, like it might storm later.
At the time, I fancied myself an inventor, and after we locked up our bikes and began the short walk across the park to the playground, I told Margo about an idea I had for an invention called the Ringolator. The Ringolator was a gigantic cannon that would shoot big, colored rocks into a very low orbit, giving Earth the same sort of rings that Saturn has. (I still think this would be a fine idea, but it turns out that building a cannon that can shoot boulders into a low orbit is fairly complicated.)
I’d been in this park so many times before that it was mapped in my mind, so we were only a few steps inside when I began to sense that the world was out of order, even though I couldn’t immediately figure out what was different.
“Quentin,” Margo said quietly, calmly.
She was pointing. And then I realized what was different.
“Quentin,” Margo said quietly, calmly.
She was pointing. And then I realized what was different.
There was a live oak a few feet ahead of us. Thick and gnarled and ancient-looking. That was not new. The playground on our right. Not new, either. But now, a guy wearing a gray suit, slumped against the trunk of the oak tree. Not moving. This was new. He was encircled by blood; a half-dried fountain of it poured out of his mouth. The mouth open in a way that mouths generally shouldn’t be. Flies at rest on his pale forehead.
“He’s dead,” Margo said, as if I couldn’t tell.
I took two small steps backward. I remember thinking that if I made any sudden movements, he might wake up and attack me. Maybe he was a zombie. I knew zombies weren’t real, but he sure looked like a potential zombie.
As I took those two steps back, Margo took two equally small and quiet steps forward. “His eyes are open,” she said.
“Wegottagohome,” I said.
“I thought you closed your eyes when you died,” she said.
“Margowegottagohomeandtell.”
She took another step. She was close enough now to reach out and touch his foot. “What do you think happened to him?” she asked. “Maybe it was drugs or something.”
I didn’t want to leave Margo alone with the dead guy who might be an attack zombie, but I also didn’t care to stand around and chat about the circumstances of his demise. I gathered my courage and stepped forward to take her hand. “Margowegottagorightnow!”
“Okay, yeah,” she said. We ran to our bikes, my stomach churning with something that felt exactly like excitement, but wasn’t. We got on our bikes and I let her go in front of me because I was crying and didn’t want her to see. I could see blood on the soles of her purple sneakers. His blood. The dead guy blood.
And then we were back home in our separate houses. My parents called 911, and I heard the sirens in the distance and asked to see the fire trucks, but my mom said no. Then I took a nap.
Both my parents are therapists, which means that I am really goddamned well adjusted. So when I woke up, I had a long conversation with my mom about the cycle of life, and how death is part of life, but not a part of life I needed to be particularly concerned about at the age of nine, and I felt better. Honestly, I never worried about it much. Which is saying something, because I can do some worrying.
Here’s the thing: I found a dead guy. Little, adorable nine-year-old me and my even littler and more adorable playdate found a guy with blood pouring out of his mouth, and that blood was on her little, adorable sneakers as we biked home. It’s all very dramatic and everything, but so what? I didn’t know the guy. People I don’t know die all the damned time. If I had a nervous breakdown every time something awful happened in the world, I’d be crazier than a shithouse rat.
 
That night, I went into my room at nine o’clock to go to bed, because nine o’clock was my bedtime. My mom tucked me in, told me she loved me, and I said, “See you tomorrow,” and she said, “See you tomorrow,” and then she turned out the lights and closed the door almost-all-the-way.
As I turned on my side, I saw Margo Roth Spiegelman standing outside my window, her face almost pressed against the screen. I got up and opened the window, but the screen stayed between us, pixelating her.
“I did an investigation,” she said quite seriously. Even up close the screen broke her face apart, but I could tell that she was holding a little notebook and a pencil with teeth marks around the eraser. She glanced down at her notes. “Mrs. Feldman from over on Jefferson Court said his name was Robert Joyner. She told me he lived on Jefferson Road in one of those condos on top of the grocery store, so I went over there and there were a bunch of policemen, and one of them asked if I worked at the school paper, and I said our school didn’t have a paper, and he said as long as I wasn’t a journalist he would answer my questions. He said Robert Joyner was thirty-six years old. A lawyer. They wouldn’t let me in the apartment, but a lady named Juanita Alvarez lives next door to him, and I got into her apartment by asking if I could borrow a cup of sugar, and then she said that Robert Joyner had killed himself with a gun. And then I asked why, and then she told me that he was getting a divorce and was sad about it.”
She stopped then, and I just looked at her, her face gray and moonlit and split into a thousand little pieces by the weave of the window screen. Her wide, round eyes flitted back and forth from her notebook to me. “Lots of people get divorces and don’t kill themselves,” I said.
“I know,” she said, excitement in her voice. “That’s what I told Juanita Alvarez. And then she said . . .” Margo flipped the notebook page. “She said that Mr. Joyner was troubled. And then I asked what that meant, and then she told me that we should just pray for him and that I needed to take the sugar to my mom, and I said forget the sugar and left.”
I said nothing again. I just wanted her to keep talking—that small voice tense with the excitement of almost knowing things, making me feel like something important was happening to me.
“I think I maybe know why,” she finally said.
“Why?”
“Maybe all the strings inside him broke,” she said.
While I tried to think of something to say in answer to that, I reached forward and pressed the lock on the screen between us, dislodging it from the window. I placed the screen on the floor, but she didn’t give me a chance to speak. Before I could sit back down, she just raised her face up toward me and whispered, “Shut the window.” So I did. I thought she would leave, but she just stood there, watching me. I waved at her and smiled, but her eyes seemed fixed on something behind me, something monstrous that had already drained the blood from her face, and I felt too afraid to turn around to see. But there was nothing behind me, of course—except maybe the dead guy.
I stopped waving. My head was level with hers as we stared at each other from opposite sides of the glass. I don’t remember how it ended—if I went to bed or she did. In my memory, it doesn’t end. We just stay there, looking at each other, forever.
 
Margo always loved mysteries. And in everything that came afterward, I could never stop thinking that maybe she loved mysteries so much that she became one.

When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen. It was true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another. Her father had held a position under the English Government and had always been busy and ill himself, and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people. She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah, who was made to understand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she must keep the child out of sight as much as possible. So when she was a sickly, fretful, ugly little baby she was kept out of the way, and when she became a sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of the way also. She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other native servants, and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying, by the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived. The young English governess who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months, and when other governesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a shorter time than the first one. So if Mary had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all.
One frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she awakened feeling very cross, and she became crosser still when she saw that the servant who stood by her bedside was not her Ayah.
“Why did you come?” she said to the strange woman. “I will not let you stay. Send my Ayah to me.”
The woman looked frightened, but she only stammered that the Ayah could not come and when Mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kicked her, she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib.
There was something mysterious in the air that morning. Nothing was done in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing, while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces. But no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come. She was actually left alone as the morning went on, and at last she wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda. She pretended that she was making a flower-bed, and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth, all the time growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the things she would say and the names she would call Saidie when she returned.
“Pig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs!” she said, because to call a native pig is the worst insult of all.
She was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she heard her mother come out on the veranda with some one. She was with a fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices. Mary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy. She had heard that he was a very young officer who had just come from England. The child stared at him, but she stared most at her mother. She always did this when she had a chance to see her, because the Mem Sahib—Mary used to call her that oftener than anything else—was such a tall, slim, pretty person and wore such lovely clothes. Her hair was like curly silk and she had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things, and she had large laughing eyes. All her clothes were thin and floating, and Mary said they were “full of lace.” They looked fuller of lace than ever this morning, but her eyes were not laughing at all. They were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy officer’s face.
“Is it so very bad? Oh, is it?” Mary heard her say. “Awfully,” the young man answered in a trembling voice.
“Awfully, Mrs. Lennox. You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago.”
The Mem Sahib wrung her hands.
“Oh, I know I ought!” she cried. “I only stayed to go to that silly dinner party. What a fool I was!”
At that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out image

She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other native servants, and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying, by the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived. The young English governess who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months, and when other governesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a shorter time than the first one. So if Mary had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all.
One frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she awakened feeling very cross, and she became crosser still when she saw that the servant who stood by her bedside was not her Ayah.
“Why did you come?” she said to the strange woman. “I will not let you stay. Send my Ayah to me.”
The woman looked frightened, but she only stammered that the Ayah could not come and when Mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kicked her, she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib.
There was something mysterious in the air that morning. Nothing was done in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing, while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces. But no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come. She was actually left alone as the morning went on, and at last she wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda. She pretended that she was making a flower-bed, and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth, all the time growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the things she would say and the names she would call Saidie when she returned.
“Pig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs!” she said, because to call a native a pig is the worst insult of all.
She was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she heard her mother come out on the veranda with some one. She was with a fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices. Mary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy. She had heard that he was a very young officer who had just come from England. The child stared at him, but she stared most at her mother. She always did this when she had a chance to see her, because the Mem Sahib—Mary used to call her that oftener than anything else—was such a tall, slim, pretty person and wore such lovely clothes. Her hair was like curly silk and she had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things, and she had large laughing eyes. All her clothes were thin and floating, and Mary said they were “full of lace.” They looked fuller of lace than ever this morning, but her eyes were not laughing at all. They were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy officer’s face.
“Is it so very bad? Oh, is it?” Mary heard her say. “Awfully,” the young man answered in a trembling voice.
“Awfully, Mrs. Lennox. You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago.”
The Mem Sahib wrung her hands.
“Oh, I know I ought!” she cried. “I only stayed to go to that silly dinner party. What a fool I was!”
At that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from the servants’ quarters that she clutched the young man’s arm, and Mary stood shivering from head to foot. The wailing grew wilder and wilder.
“What is it? What is it?” Mrs. Lennox gasped.
“Some one has died,” answered the boy officer. “You did not say it had broken out among your servants.”
“I did not know!” the Mem Sahib cried. “Come with me! Come with me!” and she turned and ran into the house.
After that, appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness of the morning was explained to Mary. The cholera had broken out in its most fatal form and people were dying like flies. The Ayah had been taken ill in the night, and it was because she had just died that the servants had wailed in the huts. Before the next day three other servants were dead and others had run away in terror. There was panic on every side, and dying people in all the bungalows.
During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by everyone.

She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour expression.
When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen. It was true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another. Her father had held a position under the English Government and had always been busy and ill himself, and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people. She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah, who was made to understand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she must keep the child out of sight as much as possible. So when she was a sickly, fretful, ugly little baby she was kept out of the way, and when she became a sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of the way also. She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other native servants, and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying, by the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived.

The Ayah had been taken ill in the night, and it was because she had just died that the servants had wailed in the huts. Before the next day three other servants were dead and others had run away in terror. There was panic on every side, and dying people in all the bungalows.
During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by everyone. Nobody thought of her, nobody wanted her, and strange things happened of which she knew nothing. Mary alternately cried and slept through the hours. She only knew that people were ill and that she heard mysterious and frightening sounds. Once she crept into the dining-room and found it empty, though a partly finished meal was on the table and chairs and plates looked as if they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly for some reason. The child ate some fruit and biscuits, and being thirsty she drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled. It was sweet, and she did not know how strong it was. Very soon it made her intensely drowsy, and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again, frightened by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of feet. The wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes open and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time.
Many things happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily, but she was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being carried in and out of the bungalow.
When she awakened she lay and stared at the wall. The house was perfectly still. She had never known it to be so silent before. She heard neither voices nor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had got well of the cholera and all the trouble was over. She wondered also who would take care of her now her Ayah was dead. There would be a new Ayah, and perhaps she would know some new stories. Mary had been rather tired of the old ones. She did not cry because her nurse had died. She was not an affectionate child and had never cared much for anyone. The noise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her, and she had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she was alive. Everyone was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no one was fond of. When people had the cholera it seemed that they remembered nothing but themselves. But if everyone had got well again, surely some one would remember and come to look for her.
But no one came, and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more and more silent. She heard something rustling on the matting and when she looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her with eyes like jewels. She was not frightened, because he was a harmless little thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get out of the room. He slipped under the door as she watched him.
“How queer and quiet it is,” she said. “It sounds as if there were no one in the bungalow but me and the snake.”
Almost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound, and then on the veranda. They were men’s footsteps, and the men entered the bungalow and talked in low voices. No one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to open doors and look into rooms.
“What desolation!” she heard one voice say. “That pretty, pretty woman! I suppose the child, too. I heard there was a child, though no one ever saw her.”
Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the door a few minutes later. She looked an ugly, cross little thing and was frowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected. The first man who came in was a large officer she had once seen talking to her father. He looked tired and troubled, but when he saw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back.
“Barney!” he cried out. “There is a child here! A child alone! In a place like this! Mercy on us, who is she!”
“I am Mary Lennox,” the little girl said, drawing herself up stiffly. She thought the man was very rude to call her father’s bungalow “A place like this!” “I fell asleep when everyone had the cholera and I have only just wakened up. Why does nobody come?”
“It is the child no one ever saw!” exclaimed the man, turning to his companions. “She has actually been forgotten!”
“Why was I forgotten?” Mary said, stamping her foot. “Why does nobody come?”
The young man whose name was Barney looked at her very sadly. Mary even thought she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink tears away.
“Poor little kid!” he said. “There is nobody left to come.”
It was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found out that she had neither father nor mother left; that they had died and been carried away in the night, and that the few native servants who had not died also had left the house as quickly as they could get out of it, none of them even remembering that there was a Missie Sahib. That was why the place was so quiet. It was true that there was no one in the bungalow but herself and the little rustling snake.

 Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar - except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole. 
    When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was  dull and gray as everything else. 
    When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun and wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray, they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at. 
    Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and di not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn and rarely spoke. 
    It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly. 
    Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at the sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes. 
    From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also.
    Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.
    "There's a cyclone coming, Em," he called to his wife. "I'll go look after the stock." Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept. 
    Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of the danger close at hand. 
    "Quick, Dorothy!" she screamed. "Run for the cellar!"
    Toto jumped out of Dorothy's arms and hid uner the bed, and the girl started to get him. Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole. Dorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt. When she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor.
    Then a strange thing happened. 
    The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air. Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.
    The north and south winds met where the house stood and made it the exact center of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easiy as you could carry a feather. 
    It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy found she was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls around, and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle. 
    Toto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there, barking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen. 
    Once Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first the little girl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall. She crept to the hole, caught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again, afterward closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen. 
    Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright; but she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf. At first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring. At last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and Toto followed and lay down beside her. 
    In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind, Dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep. 
    
    “Sir?” she repeats. “How soon do you want it to get there?”
I rub two fingers, hard, over my left eyebrow. The throbbing has become intense. “It doesn’t matter,” I say.
The clerk takes the package. The same shoebox that sat on my porch less than twenty-four hours ago; rewrapped in a brown paper bag, sealed with clear packing tape, exactly as I had received it. But now addressed with a new name. The next name on Hannah Baker’s list.
“Baker’s dozen,” I mumble. Then I feel disgusted for even noticing it.
“Excuse me?”
I shake my head. “How much is it?”
She places the box on a rubber pad, then punches a sequence on her keypad.
I set my cup of gas-station coffee on the counter and glance at the screen. I pull a few bills from my wallet, dig some coins out of my pocket, and place my money on the counter.
“I don’t think the coffee’s kicked in yet,” she says. “You’re missing a dollar.”
I hand over the extra dollar, then rub the sleep from my eyes. The coffee’s lukewarm when I take a sip, making it harder to gulp down. But I need to wake up somehow.
Or maybe not. Maybe it’s best to get through the day half-asleep. Maybe that’s the only way to get through today.
“It should arrive at this address tomorrow,” she says. “Maybe the day after tomorrow.” Then she drops the box into a cart behind her.
I should have waited till after school. I should have given Jenny one final day of peace.
Though she doesn’t deserve it.
When she gets home tomorrow, or the next day, she’ll find a package on her doorstep. Or if her mom or dad or someone else gets there first, maybe she’ll find it on her bed. And she’ll be excited. I was excited. A package with no return address? Did they forget, or was it intentional? Maybe from a secret admirer?
“Do you want your receipt?” the clerk asks.
I shake my head.
A small printer clicks one out anyway. I watch her tear the slip across the serrated plastic and drop it into a wastebasket.
There’s only one post office in town. I wonder if the same clerk helped the other people on the list, those who got this package before me. Did they keep their receipts as sick souvenirs? Tuck them in their underwear drawers? Pin them up on corkboards?
I almost ask for my receipt back. I almost say, “I’m sorry, can I have it after all?” As a reminder.
But if I wanted a reminder, I could’ve made copies of the tapes or saved the map. But I never want to hear those tapes again, though her voice will never leave my head. And the houses, the streets, and the high school will always be there to remind me.
It’s out of my control now. The package is on its way. I leave the post office without the receipt.
Deep behind my left eyebrow, my head is still pounding. Every swallow tastes sour, and the closer I get to school, the closer I come to collapsing.
I want to collapse. I want to fall on the sidewalk right there and drag myself into the ivy. Because just beyond the ivy the sidewalk curves, following the outside of the school parking lot. It cuts through the front lawn and into the main building. It leads through the front doors and turns into a hallway, which meanders between rows of lockers and classrooms on both sides, finally entering the always-open door to first period.
At the front of the room, facing the students, will be the desk of Mr. Porter. He’ll be the last to receive a package with no return address. And in the middle of the room, one desk to the left, will be the desk of Hannah Baker.
Empty.
